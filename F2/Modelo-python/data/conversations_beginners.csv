so i knew he lied then we checked jim's table,his pot of tea was almost full and we found a half empty water bottle

the world the road through it is next to the li wu,river it is so pretty
i loved looking up at the gorge walls and then down into the river,i really liked the tunnel of nine turns some parts of the tunnel are open
you can look down at the river and in some places the gorge is really,narrow the mountains around here are really
beautiful they are so different from the mountains,at home in colorado mountains here are not as high and they

her pants were spotless she was really upset when you told her,that she was
but i hope she learned her lesson me too,now let's go wait in the river and then have a nice dinner
now look at these examples here my boyfriend's very tall okay very very,tall my boyfriend's very tall i think
I am quite short quite short that means that I am not,really short I am just quite short okay
i think I am quite short he has not really tall,about average not really toward that means not tor not short about average
okay he has not really tall about average his,brother is pretty short pretty just like pretty
just like quiet and really just like very really or very,very tall really tall quite short pretty short okay
his brother is pretty short she has about 170,centimeters tall okay you can use centimeters here
she has about 170 centimeters tall,i guess if you do not know you can make a guess i guess he has about five feet
nine inches usually in western countries people like to use feet an inch right i,guess he has about five feet nine inches
again my brother sorry my boyfriend's very,tall i think I am quite short
he has not very tall sorry he has not really tall about average,his brother is pretty short
she has about 107 centimeters tall,i guess he has about five feet nine inches now let's go to the example i have four
questions here how,are you 180 centimeters tall like you look at a
person and then you guess i maybe like he is 180 centimeters and then you can,ask him are you 180 centimeters tall am i right okay
how tall are you like i want to know like your,measurement how tall are you now i want to know your height
are you shorter than your sister okay like,your your sister is taller than you right or you are shorter than your
sister right are you shorter than your sister,who is the tallest in your family okay a lot of people but who is the tallest
who is the tallest in your family now let's see the answers for number one are,you 180 centimeters torr
yes i am yes right or no I am not and then you can,say your heart I am 175 centimeters tall yes i am no I am not
I am 175 centimeters tall again are you,180 centimeters tall yes i am or no I am not I am
175 centimeters tall number two how tall are you,I am about six feet if you are not sure you cannot say I am about six feet okay
are you shorter than your sister if that is true you say yes i am or,or no we are about the same height that means
like for example like I am six feet and she has six feet two so we are about the,same height or we are at the same height okay um
now we are about at the same height so again,are you shorter than your sister yes i am or no we are about the same
height who is the tallest,in your family i think that is the tallest in my family
maybe your dad your sister your brother anyone,okay i think that is the tallest in my family or if
you are sure about that you will say definitely that is the toilets in my,family okay but if you are not sure you can say i think i guess
i think that is the top that is the tallest in my family,text

what happened well,mia found out I am scared of shots so she started teasing me about that and
then i did not need any shots but the doctor said i needed a blood test,were you scared not really

learn a lot at headquarters true,but will i like it I am not sure do you prefer working with
customers or in an office i do not know i never worked in an office,i'd rather work with customers i do not like sitting at a desk all day
that's one difference between you and me you'll spend lots of time at a desk in,college erin true
hey becca if you leave,can i manage the net cafe hi guys
hi rita can i help you,no i just needed five minutes away from
work jeff can be really serious sometimes i,know what you mean maybe brazil would be nice
greg i thought we weren't telling people yet,telling people what nothing
why do you two look so nervous nervous,we are not nervous what is going on do you want to tell her or should i tell
her you tell her i think you should then why did you ask,if i should guys one of you had better tell me or i will
be very disappointed,okay we'll tell you
wildlife magazine offered greg a job in brazil,what i sent them pictures from our trip i
just hoped they'd like them and they did that's great greg,but do you two really want to live in brazil
it would be a big change i've never thought of leaving the us,but it would be an adventure and you know i like a good adventure
we are not sure if we are going or not,i do not want to play anymore i hate this game
what is wrong aaron do not worry about it nick,it is not important are you sure i want to go to college
but i still have so many questions to answer,like what like how will i pay for college
yes that will be hard and there are other questions too,what are you going to do i do not know
sometimes i just want to give up that's how i felt when the band broke up,but then becca told us not to give up and now
we have a great band right,well then i guess i should not give up
right scott hey rita is something wrong,yes we just got fired
what are you kidding,no well we did not really get fired rita
we were let go uh yeah,that's just a nice way to say you are fired
i cannot believe it both of you were fired,i mean let go on the same day
yeah what is going on,there is not enough money in our school district's budget
so they had to fire many of the music,pe and art teachers
that's terrible,they cannot treat you like that I am so sorry this happened to you two
what are you going to do now i have no idea,i do you do
what pray,pray yes
ask god for help hello greg hi scott,hey I am sorry you lost your job at the school

you are moving yes uh why do you have to move,because my university is in canada canada

health nut and maybe get a coaching job in tampa,thanks but this coaching job is a great
opportunity for me i think i should take it,we'll miss you man uh hi nick

mom probably forgot though again well,she has a good excuse this time she got fired yesterday fired no way
yeah I am worried about her,she has been in her room a lot since she found out
is she thinking about what she has gonna do for a living now,i guess so she does not need to work for a living dad makes enough money
hey maybe she could be a full-time artist,you know sell her paintings and stuff that's not a bad idea
what would you do if you were her i'd say,I am glad i do not have to work anymore now i have more time to spend with my
wonderful daughter you would mom,are you okay i am
actually i think losing my job could be a good,opportunity for me what do you mean mrs gibson

hi erin hi mom's meeting me here for coffee she,says she has a surprise for me what do you think it is
i do not know but mom says i'll like it hi mom,so what is the surprise you cannot wait can you
no okay,we are going to take a trip to europe europe i've always wanted to travel to
europe i know when are we going where are we going how,long can we stay we'll go during your christmas vacation
we'll stay about a week but where will we go,dad says you and i can decide wow
let's go to paris rome london,wait a minute we'll only have a week for sightseeing
that's right you cannot see all the famous places in one week so we should,choose one place yes
okay what do i want to see in europe,paris is famous for great art museums london also has some great museums
and we can speak english there so how are we going to decide,why do not you look on the computer good idea
let's see which cities have things we really want to see,there are so many places to go in europe let's just choose two cities and decide
between them that would be easier,we can each choose one where do you want to go
paris i think why,i want to go to paris to see the louvre what about you amber i want to go to
london there are lots of attractions there,though you'll decide between paris and london
right there are some cool castles in london,i know those would be fun to see
so let's go to london but i would love to see the eiffel tower in paris too,which city is easier to get around both cities have subways
that would be the best way to travel around this is not going to be an easy,decision paris and london both have interesting
attractions and delicious food,and cool stores and they are both expensive you cannot choose the cheaper
place how are we going to decide,well let's go home and talk to dad
right we'll just have to tell him tell him what,tell him we need a longer vacation hi honey

i have my own business and it is profitable,it is also good that you like what you do that's true
i love my music store it must be fun to do something you love,it is do not you like working at the stop and
shop it is not bad,but it is not easy i always have to compare prices with
other stores i know what you mean,every month I am figuring out what our prices should be
right you are always asking yourself,are prices too high what would happen if prices were lower
right it is not fun,and it is hard to compete with large discount
stores it is,i wish i could just have a nice little store with no problems
i do not like worrying about being profitable every month,that's business but it is also exciting right
it has been but i've thought about doing something,else really
what would you like to do managing the stop and shop is not an,adventure but
managing profit and loss margins every month,can be exciting you really think so
i have to admit liz i like business,really i like it almost as much as i like music
wow that's great so what are you going to do,nothing the stop and shop might not be exciting
but it is a good business besides what else would i do,i do not know what do you like
i like adventure i loved brazil,well business is an adventure
maybe one month is a down month the adventure is trying to do better the,next month right right
some months i just break even but even that's fun because i know i did,lose money you are right it is an adventure

another drink sir no thank you,excuse me is anyone sitting here no
please have a seat that's better my feet are killing me,have you been here long no but i just flew in this morning and i
have not had a chance to sit down since then,no where have you come from
from manila is this your first visit to australia no,i have been once before but it was a long time ago
and have you been to sydney before no it is an amazing city,yes it has its points but you are lucky to live in manila it is a fascinating
city what about yourself,do you live in sydney no i live in melbourne I am just here for
the conference I am going to melbourne later,what is the weather like there not too good in winter but at the moment
it should be okay so,how is your hotel it is good very convenient
just near the harbour have you seen the opera house yet yes we,flew right over it excuse me there's someone i must talk to
it is been very nice to meet you I am walter by the way you too I am sue,perhaps we'll meet later i hope so
has everybody got a copy of the agenda would you mind taking minutes john,not at all good well then let's get started
first of all thank you everyone for attending at,short notice as you know the objective of this
meeting of the capital works committee is to discuss a proposal for some urgent,building work at our south side plant as we have got to reach a decision which
may involve spending we'll run it as a formal meeting,now you have read the proposal so without further ado i'd like to open
it up for discussion or perhaps if we can start with you tan,what is your view well I am not convinced that the work is
as urgent as this report suggests so to sum up i think we are all aware,that some urgent work does need to be done and we will need to work on a
longer term plan for a major refit well,if there's no more discussion we'll put it to a vote
we are recommending that tenders be called for the urgent work needed,all those in favor all those against
then that's agreed any other business,then we'll close the meeting thank you everyone the next meeting will
be in two weeks at the same time well I am not convinced that the work is,as urgent as this report suggests so perhaps come on the building is
practically falling down sorry lin i do not think tan had finished we'll get,to you in a minute sorry as i was saying
perhaps we should get a second opinion before we spend any money,thank you tan what is your opinion walter
well as far as I am concerned it is a question of safety so i think we should,go ahead are you suggesting that someone could
get hurt in my opinion yes if you ask me there is a serious risk of,an accident and it is not a recent problem
are you implying we should have done something earlier,much earlier it is a real concern here in that case i agree
we should do something now i think so too,thank you walter well if there's no excuse me madam
chairperson yes barbara what about the problem with parking there were no,places again this morning maybe if you got to work on time
all comments through the chair if you do not mind walter,parking is not on the agenda for this meeting
perhaps you could suggest it for our next meeting barbara,well if there's no more discussion we'll put it to a vote here here
okay now we are looking at the options for,handling our online orders they are going through the roof and frankly the lead
time for delivery is blowing out we need to improve our performance in,this area any suggestions
well as i said we have three options the obvious one is to employ more people,to do the job another alternative is to automate the
system more cut down on the physical handling,and the third option we could outsource
what are the pros and cons well looking at increasing staff versus,automation we have to consider the cost automating has a higher capital cost
than putting on more staff on the other hand employing more people,is more expensive over a long term if we keep growing it'll cost more in
the long run how likely is it that we'll see,continued growth i'd say it is a certainty
i'd say a high probability nothing certain in business,so what about the third option outsourcing
it does take the problem off our hands but we lose contact with our customers,what about the bottom line outsourcing is the cheapest option and
the easiest in the short term but if we want to keep the operation in,house the best option is automating our system
the only downside is we are taking a risk that our business will keep growing,which we hope it will we certainly do today we are looking at our new widget
plant being built at south side i've asked barbara to report on progress and,bring us up to date and up to speed barbara thanks denise
i'll just outline the process we have been through identify some problems and give,you an estimate on completion time and the outcome financially is it good news
or bad news bear with me,now if you recall after a feasibility study we put the
project out to 10 to 18 months ago and selected easy build as our project,manager work commenced about 15 months ago and
it is been progressing to schedule until recently,what is the problem unfortunately there are
three firstly there's been a delay in materials,specifically steel because of industrial issues at the suppliers
secondly we have lost days due to the weather,and finally there's been a resulting cost blowout
so what are we going to do well they have managed to get another,supplier now i suggested moving the completion date
back that way there's no penalty and they agreed to redeploy their workers,until building can start again smart thinking
we have been waiting for the rain to stop but we cannot control the weather,and the cost at this stage just a small overage but
i'll be watching it very closely over the next few months,with no more delays we are expecting to complete the project
just one month behind schedule good work barbara,now i'd like to refer to the first graph as you can see this is a bar graph
measuring net sales over the first 10 months of the year,you'll notice that sales rose steadily in the first few months
then there was a marked increase in april,they peaked in may at around 3.2 million and leveled off
then there was a dramatic drop in the following month,followed by a significant increase in august and this trend has continued up
until the present what was the reason for the sudden drop,in july this was mainly due to a drop-off in air
conditioner sales so it is a seasonal effect,could it be a consequence of the negative effect of the interest rate
rise possibly,now if i could draw your attention to this next diagram
this is a line graph of sales the blue line represents air conditioner,sales the red line shows heaters
as you'll note air conditioner sales dropped steadily from january to july,bottoming out then while heater sales experienced a sharp
increase from march to june then dropped markedly from june to july,then declined through to september with a pronounced drop in october
does this explain the fluctuation in total sales largely if we look at this,pie diagram you can see that air conditioners and
heaters together represent more than half of our total sales,but they vary seasonally while other appliances are fairly steady through the
year well we cannot sell air conditioners when,it is cold what is the solution
export to europe and america easier said than done,today I am going to look at the results of our customer survey
first i'll go through the survey questions,then summarise the results and finally i'll outline the conclusions
after that there'll be time for questions and discussion so,let's start with the survey questions turning to the results
as you can see from the diagram most people decided what to buy when,they saw the product at the showroom about one-third made their decision
based on what the salesperson said the others knew what they wanted to buy,already most of those made their decision on the
recommendation of a friend only a few said they relied on,advertising let's move on to the conclusions
the first one is that it is very important that,salespeople on the floor know about our products
another is that after sales service is critical,people who experience good after sales service are more likely to recommend a
brand and finally,advertising it is expensive so we need to make sure
we are getting results so i'd like to end with a summary of,what i've looked at today and some recommendations
the figures show that sales are strongly seasonal and that customers depend on,good information on the showroom floor so i'd like to recommend we concentrate
on discounting in the off seasons and spend more time on briefing our sales,representatives that's all i have for now
are there any questions you mentioned that the sales figures,may also reflect economic trends can you expand on that
well we are always going to depend on the economy,as i understand it we can look forward to an improvement this year
does that answer your question are you saying we are in for a period of,growth well I am afraid that's a bit outside my
area of expertise but that's what the papers are suggesting,if you believe it you suggested that we might be spending
too much on advertising can you clarify that,it is hard to quantify without better data
sorry could you repeat that,we do not have the figures to really know how effective our advertising is
in my experience you cannot do without advertising,time for one last question i have one yes john
is it time for coffee okay we'll wrap up now,thank you for your input everyone thank you
wilson wilson can i help you yes this is lynn chan from acme appliances i'd like,to speak to mr wilson if he has available please would that be mr wilson senior or
mr wilson jr mr wilson senior i'll just see if he has available hold the,line please
it is a lynn chan from acme I am sorry mr wilson's in a meeting at,the moment may i take a message yes could you ask him to phone me please
my number is two three double one five six five four I am sorry,i did not catch your name lin chan acme appliances let me check
the number two three double one five six five four that's right,i'll pass that message on thank you thanks bye
acme appliances lynn chan speaking this is tom wilson returning your call,ah yes mr wilson thanks for calling back i wanted to set up a meeting with you to
discuss your requirements for next year yes certainly how about uh,thursday at 2 30. that would be fine
okay i look forward to seeing you then thursday 2 30. see you then goodbye,goodbye hello lin chan sales manager for
national sugar and my associate john martin very pleased to meet you I am,victor tang and this is my legal advisor sue panet i hope you had a pleasant
flight over yes we did thanks are you staying for a few days unfortunately we,need to get back to manila tomorrow well we'd better get down to business
mr tang to start off with i just want to say we believe we can offer you a very,good deal and come up with a win-win result well from our point of view we
see it as an exploratory tool testing the water you might say we do not intend,to reach any agreements at this meeting in any case we would need to run it past
our board first you have not heard our terms yet you may find them hard to,resist of course we understand you need time to
consider any offer my first priority is to keep the negotiations open,what is your proposal ms chen we are prepared to offer a very
attractive price for a minimum sale in exchange for a two-year contract john,will clarify the terms so that's our offer we believe it is a
fair one with advantages for both sides yes well we are prepared to consider your,offer miss chant if you can accept some conditions
and subject to consideration by the board,what are the conditions well firstly the price you are proposing
would that be variable depending on currency fluctuations,the issue is that we are in an unstable environment at the moment
the exchange rate could affect us negatively,us too true
but the problem is that we are tied to the u.s dollar we could consider hedging,against currency in both directions that would be acceptable
another problem we may have is that of supply,our customers often need supply at short notice if we do get large orders we need
to guarantee delivery so we need the stockpile,the difficulty there is the capital outlay
how would you feel about a partial offset against our sales you mean alone,i suppose so would you be agreeable to a deferred
payment we can provide security of course,i think that would be acceptable unfortunately i would need to get board
approval for it of course,then i think we might have a deal in principle
time to celebrate our keynote speaker is a man who I am,sure is very well known to all of you he has professor of fruitology at dubbo
university and has written many books on the subject of tropical fruit,so without further ado i'd like to introduce our keynote speaker dr sam
erics thank you denise,the honourable judith bryant minister for trade professor eric vogel professor
of economics at wagga university distinguished guests ladies and,gentlemen today's topic why bananas are bent
is a very significant one in terms both of international trade and culture,in thinking about the topic i felt it would be appropriate to address briefly
the history of bananas and banana farming the many qualities of bananas,both positive and negative and of course examine the uses of the
banana but first,let me tell you a story about a banana ladies and gentlemen i hope i've been
able to clear up a few misconceptions and leave you with some new ideas about,how we might view bananas in the future we have seen in looking at their history
that bananas have a significant role in many cultures,i've also noted their positive nutritional qualities
and in addressing the main question why bananas are bent we have learned that the,reasons are many and complex madam chair thank you for the
opportunity to address the conference today and thank you ladies and gentlemen,for your kind attention well it has been a great pleasure to
meet you sam and lynn yes we have enjoyed meeting you too victor yes it is been,great what a pity you have to go home well all good things must come to an end

this is miranda cunningham i would like to talk to the customer,service yes how can i help this is miranda cunningham are you all
right no I am not all right we are freezing,the heating system is not working i'll send someone in the afternoon or
tomorrow morning make it this afternoon as i said we are,freezing this is a legal firm and we have a lot
of taxing work to do and it is anything but easy at this,temperature yeah i called yesterday to explain the
situation and i say you do not have to see you have to,come what is your name please i
am matthew peacock mr peacock if things are not put right,straight away i will make a complaint to your superiors
good morning let me give it another try,hi this is rose hi this is miranda cunningham
listen we have had no heating since monday,i called yesterday and today but I am terribly sorry to hear that mrs
cunningham tell me more about what happened so that,i can solve your problem well there's very little to say
the heating system is not working and we tried to fix it but to no avail,i understand let me apologize for the inconvenience
i'll send someone to settle the matter right away,you cannot imagine how happy i am to hear that
well we have a good working relationship but i am just the secretary,and miranda constantly reminds me that she has the boss
I am always here early because i absolutely have to clock in by nine,o'clock so i usually get to work around 8 45
just in case but miranda arrives late all the time and nobody says anything of,course no i do not work fixed hours and
sometimes i stay in the office after work because we have to meet,deadlines so it can be very stressful it is okay but most of the time i do
routine tasks i file documents answer the phone reply to,emails so I am usually stuck behind a desk
it can be morning linda good morning i never,managed to get here on time traffic is so bad this time of the
morning I am surprised you are always so punctual,you get to work early what time do you leave your house in the
morning usually around 20 past eight i take the tube it is quite quick,but once or twice a week i drive to work so i leave the house around eight
o'clock because there can be a lot do we have today's newspaper yes read me,my horoscope let's see what the week is like
scorpio work control your sharp tongue today,try not to be too critical and severe is there anything about love
love you usually say things that upset or offend people,what do you think I am tactless you want me to continue no no thank you
linda just a cup of coffee thanks,sorry for bursting in like this but there's a very attractive man in
reception and he says he has here to fix the coffee machine,we'll end it is not broken it works perfectly well and we still have plenty
of paper cups stirrers white and brown sugar coffee,and even two types of tea well so then tell them that we do not
need anything and the machine works just fine,but he has here now and he has very attractive and i thought perhaps we
could have him check the machine just in case i see,well perhaps we could spice up the day a bit let him in
certainly thanks this is mrs cunningham the boss good,afternoon hi troy yeah I am here to repair the
coffee machine sold in the cells and what is it we also,have one of your vending machines with chocolates and biscuits
you see linda and i have a sweet tooth but we also have certain dietary,requirements icing some of my clients are allergic to wheat
and some are vegans liz is a vegetarian are not you linda,yes yes i am so is it possible to have some wheat free snacks
and some that are suitable for vegans as well well I am not sure I am just a,technician i repair the machines well perhaps we
can have them send us a brochure with the products sure and the coffee,machine no problem it works just fine but
perhaps there is a small problem with the hot chocolate,it tends to be a bit watery is there any way to make it creamier
let's have a look linda why do not you show troy where the machine is,of course mrs cunningham
well I am sorry to say that there are quite a few mistakes in this report of,yours mistakes are you sure yes
but linda can type it again right sure she can but,I am a bit worried about her you know why linda is a high flyer but these days
she has working too much and she has making some embarrassing mistakes,such as well such as sending an email to mr scorn instead of mrs scoring
you know that couple going through the troublesome divorce can you imagine that,i see linda is a nice girl but she is probably overworked underpaid
and frustrated are you seeing them treating her badly,no i just think that maybe she has too much to do
and she needs less work and more motivation,what do you suggest find another secretary
are you joking she handles my phone calls,she writes emails she deals with the clients and she speaks both german and
spanish fluently i cannot imagine working without her,right i know it is hard without a good secretary so
try and do something to make her feel more motivated,motivation and job satisfaction are at the basis of everything
for instance give her something different to do,and ask for her opinion from time to time
a pay rise is also a good idea sure a pay rise is always a nice way to get,what you want from an employee what time is it 3 30.
good let me see if there is anything left to do ah yes miranda left me this,paper to retype what is it the scorns divorce papers
help they are full of mistakes I am afraid miranda is not very satisfied,with my work maybe i can find another job with
better benefits and a higher salary too there are many vacancies on the internet,i can send a letter of application with my cv
and see if i get a job interview good morning so you are linda,linda hardy right right i am linda hardy nice to meet you
tell me about yourself i am the personal assistant to miranda cunningham,i have over five years experience and I am particularly skilled
in public relations i know your company and I am very impressed with your,innovative approach i would like to be a part of your team
that sounds convincing what do you think are your weak points,hmm keeping cool under pressure perhaps but with my years of experience
I am getting quite good at dealing with stressful situations,is your employer satisfied with your job performance
help what a question not always dropping coffee on a very,important document is never a good idea no i cannot say that
at present my boss often tells me she has very happy with my work,phew after this interview I am feeling quite hungry
i need a nice hot cup of tea and a sandwich too,hi this is miranda cunningham can i speak to lawrence please
miranda it is me nice to hear from you what can i do for you,I am calling to arrange a meeting with you we need to talk about mr and mrs
divorce there are some problems with property division,can we make an appointment right away certainly
what is convenient for you how about tuesday morning at,11 sorry I am typed up all day on tuesday sometime on wednesday
morning what about wednesday at 10 that's fine,by me let me take note of that in my diary
maybe it would be better to meet in my office this time,i mean your office is fine i know the old mahogany desk belonged to your
grandfather remus and the green armchairs to your aunt evelyn,but our meeting room has a huge table comfortable chairs and last but not
least a vending machine that makes much better tea,first of all i want to thank you both for helping me with tomorrow's

vacation well i visited london you know i love,traveling great what countries have which
countries have you been i've been to several countries like,canada india and thailand though though and this one
you know the same although although the same meaning,okay look at the example though my brother
is short he is really handsome uh okay like the difference,uh one is short and one is handsome so you know they are contrast right
so we use those to show the contrast though my brother is short he has,really handsome sorry handsome number two this one
thought thought if it is a noun it means something you think and,thought if it is the past simple form it is the passive form of the verb think
to think okay so that is thought,thought i have not thought about that i have not thought
about that that means i never think about that i,have not thought about that number three
this is the i know this one is very difficult to pronounce,thread just like three through through
through okay through so through usually through,it is a preposition it usually goes with other verbs to form uh
phrasal verbs to form different meaning for example here,hope that we all get through the exams get through the exams that
mean to pass the exams sarah for british english,we pronounce thera for american english we say verbo thorough okay
thorough or thorough but i usually say thera thera if a person,is a thera that means that person does think very
carefully and with great attention to detail,very very careful okay sarah she she has uh you can say
she has a very thorough woman she has a very thorough woman,rough okay rough that means we usually talk about service for
example the table service the road service the,floor something like that or maybe your skin for example like
uh if you talk about rough rough that mean,not even not regular or not smooth so rough
here for example my skin remember skin skin okay my skin,is quite that means pretty quite rough and hard rough
not smooth and hard that means not soft okay my skin,is quite rough and hard for number six uh i think a lot of people might know
this one but it is not but it is not you know like,or something like this this is ah okay cough cough for british english
and for american english corf corf cafe or corf the same um,that is a verb or noun if it is a noun for example when you are
sick or when you have a code you are like this,so that is corf okay cough or cough our mom
has had a curve for a week okay for,link them together for a week hada had a cough had a cough for a week
has had our mom has hadou sorry our mom has had a court for a week,that means a week ago she had she
started half the court but and right now she still have the corpse okay,so that is our mom has had a court

thank you goodbye mrs lee you have got an exceptional cv,well thank you mr stevens i do not quite understand
why you left spectre according to this you were in a position of considerable,responsibility that's true i was very satisfied with my
job at the beginning i had a very,prestigious position and many high-profile projects were sent
my way however once spector was taken over by a,japanese multinational things just took a turn to the worse my
boss was let go many of my colleagues was transferred,and i was relieved of my duties and of
course well maybe i should not tell you,please do no reason to be afraid well the truth is i just did not get
along with my new boss i appreciate your frankness sincerity,is one of the main qualities that i look for in my employees
but tell me mrs lee how are your bookkeeping,invoicing and administrative skills excellent i would say but i wanted to
speak to you about and are you familiar with the publishing,market uh yes to a certain degree
but as i was saying ever since i was a child i've always been fascinated by,you can tell me about your dreams at another time mrs lee
currently we are busy with our year-end balance sheet,and i need a well-trained assistant to prepare an assessment of our
administrative expenses and to study our assets and liabilities,you considering your experiences appear to
be a perfect fit well thank you mr stevens but once,this emergency has blown over i was wondering if perhaps you could take me
into consideration as a as a yes as,an author I am quite talented my literature professor at university
used to encourage me this is not a school mrs lee,i got in touch with you to speak to you about
our marketing office that's what i'd like to hire you for,please do not be offended but keep your dreams to yourself for the
moment as far as books are concerned we can get,started on the bookkeeping immediately certainly but later we'll see
we'll see excuse me my name's victoria lee today's,my first day at work and i'd like to know
great great way to start where is everybody mr,stevens told me i was going to meet my new colleagues
and they were going to explain everything i wonder if i've come to the,wrong department ah you must be the new arrival pleasure
to meet you I am rachel the pleasure's all mine my name's victoria lee,mr stevens asked me to show you the office and explain everything
so over there is the facts in the photocopier,this is your desk and computer um what else
yes you'll find a coffee machine down the hall but please,remember a few breaks and please keep them short
this gentleman is gary reynolds head of marketing,how do you do I am victoria mr stevens tells me that we are going to be working
closely together i must say it is quite a pleasure to spend so much time with such,a lovely young lady happily married woman married with a son
as a matter of fact well done victoria let him know who's,who gary's the kind of guy who cannot control
himself with attractive women thank you for the,compliment rachel let's get down to work
here's an analysis of last year's investments,as you can see we have consistently improved our bottom line in all sectors
even if as far as I am concerned we need to move more aggressively into the,market what exactly do you mean well improve
our e-commerce play for example um let's imagine for a moment that,pilgrim were to develop an advanced online catalog that would allow users to
purchase directly online do not you think that this way we could dramatically cut,our distribution costs certainly but what does mr stevens think
well he has a bit old school in his way of thinking,according to his world view we should focus on sales through more traditional
channels i on the other hand would be thrilled if,you saw things more along my lines why do not we develop a realistic
marketing strategy that includes possible e-commerce earnings,uh perhaps we could convince them together
I am afraid i cannot at the moment gary i've got to focus on the bookkeeping to,begin with listen uh why do not we have a little
dinner together tonight and then continue working at my house,I am married remember gary
statistics accounts reports not much has changed from spectre,and i was hoping for a more creative position
hello you must be the new hire I am anne baxter,I am victoria lee i recognize your name have we met before
i do not think so or perhaps we met at the red lion pub,i often go there with my friends no it does not sound familiar
actually i have a son so i do not get out much but still i've heard your name,before just a moment now i remember we met on
the telephone when i was still working at spectre,we both had that problem with our courier fast
yes yes i remember now you were having problems with a shipment,to to china gosh what a coincidence
well who would have ever thought we would end up working together so,how are things going well it is still too early to say today's my first day at
work well i presume you have already met gary yes,earlier we are working on a project together and i
bet he has already invited you out to dinner yes as a matter of fact,and he has probably told you that he loves working with
charming young girls such as yourself yes and how do you know,he always uses the same line he did the same with me
how original well I am pleased that you have joined us here and well,i hope we'll become great friends yes well I am
sure we will you are very nice and who knows maybe that telephone call was,destiny
who's in charge of delivery to the blue moon bookshop,uh annandai why they have just telephoned complaining that they have not received
anything yet well that's impossible i sent the delivery five days ago that's,just it i do not understand what could have
happened the merchandise should have arrived by now,and call the shipping agents to find out what is up
hello am i speaking to fast shipping this is anne baxter from pilgrim,publishing i'd like to follow up on the merchandise we sent five days
ago sorry that's impossible,there must be some mistake you cannot have delivered it
our client has just telephone saying that they have not received anything yet,okay okay i'll take a look at the paperwork and get back to you
bye-bye fast claims that the goods were signed for by the,consignee rachel go get the bill of lading
we need to look into what caused this mistake,gary are you sure you provided the exact address
certainly i still remember it it is 35 lafayette avenue orange,that's it all right what about the duty do you remember paying it duty excuse me
mr stevens but we are eu members and not required to pay duty merchandise is free,to move between the member states and duty is no longer required nor is
documentation eu what does europe have to do with it,excuse me but orange is in france is not it good god gary
blue moon is in orange but not in france orange is a city in,massachusetts usa call the bookshop
immediately what an idiot that's why i paid less,on freight charges and was budgeted hello pilgrim publishing this is anne
baxter how may i help you hello this is victoria lee I am calling,in regards to the shipment i was wondering if you had any news yet
yes actually i was just about to call you,unfortunately there's been a misunderstanding
uh but do not worry we are taking care of things on our end,and you should receive the goods very soon could you tell me exactly what is
happened my boss is extremely upset the shipping,documents were in order according to the bill of lading the
supply should have already arrived can you explain why the merchandise is,blocked in the custom warehouse customs
no you see I am afraid there's been a slight problem,in addressing the goods and they have been sent to a destination in france instead
of massachusetts france massachusetts what are you,talking about the merchandise was destined for china
china excuse me um are you the owner of the,blue moon in orange massachusetts no I am not
i work for spectre we are a multinational sporting goods manufacturer,I am speaking with fast shipping well actually no this is
pilgrim publishing I am afraid you have got the wrong number,but we do have something in common we both use the same career
life is funny i dial the wrong number and who do i call a publishing house,maybe it is fate nice young woman as well what was her name anne baxter that's
right we use the same couriers and are both,having problems with deliveries what a strange coincidence mrs lee
have you spoken with fast shippers yet not yet the number's always busy we have,to figure out what is happened this delivery delay is costing us a lot
of money the courier assured us that the,merchandise did not have to pass through customs that it would have left their
warehouse with the customs bill already compiled without any additional,customs requirements that's right considering the shipping
costs they are so high because they include all,international delivery costs such as transit
loading and unloading assembly and warehouse storage costs,just a moment i've got it did you remember to attach the
certificate of origin mrs lee the certificate of origin i do not really,know what that is it is never been required for our
shipments the certificate of origin is that document which states the,merchandise's country of origin for customs purposes
it is absolutely necessary for companies doing business in countries which do not,belong to the eu provided upon customs officials request
and china is one of those countries I am sorry mrs,collins i did not know i swear it up until now
i've never taken care of shipments this is going to be one very,expensive mistake by the way i'll be taking our losses
caused by this delay out of your salary,hi victoria why we are until the meeting this morning
which meeting the meeting the mrs collins called,with all the department heads to come to grips with the situation
and i quote to discuss the means with which we can improve,both production and company efficiencies no one told me anything
i bet she did that on purpose my darling boss,she wanted to get back at me for a mistake i made on a shipment
she always keeps me out of the loop on all the important developments and makes,me do the work of a secretary i hate her come on victoria chin up
things will get better I am not sure about that paul,anyway tell me what did you discuss at the meeting
well you can imagine the tone the mrs collins used she prefers cold,and distant she urged us all to work even harder
to overcome this difficult moment for the company,according to her we should be working 24 7
365. listen to this she told the warehouse manager to,calculate the efficiency of workers more precisely
as they go about their tasks and if necessary,to lengthen their hours then she invited mr rover
the personal director to evaluate the necessity of any new hiring,she told him that from now on each and every short-term or long-term plan
must first be evaluated and approved by her,i always said she was a dictator yeah and she claims that we should be
delighted at her flexibility and the many corporate heads she knows,would jar result with a huge personnel cuts
to improve the situation what an understanding woman,you bet then she added the companies need
to meet deadlines and to work within strict budget,in order to keep clients satisfied and remain competitive in the market
finally referring to you she reminded us all the delays and,errors in projects are absolutely unacceptable
what are you doing victoria are you taking notes,no I am writing my letter of resignation paul do not tell me this is true
are you really gonna leave yes paul i just cannot stay here since mrs collins,has arrived the work climate has become unbearable
she never misses an opportunity to humiliate me and to assign me the most,demeaning tasks and what are you going to do now well
i've got in touch with a number of companies,this afternoon for example i have an interview
with a publishing house publishing house you are not going to become an author are,you precisely you know it is always been a dream of
mine i do not think the interview is going to focus on my,literary talents but paul you look awful what is the matter
I am a bit concerned about things we are having a meeting with the major,shareholders of spectre to take a look at the balance sheets and
is that a problem well as you know the ear and balance,sheets provide an overview of the economical
fiscal and fiduciary effectiveness of our management and i certainly hope,that scrutinizing the books will not uncover inconvenient discrepancies
that could lead to a change over company leadership,what exactly are you referring to as you know things have not been rosy
lately even if there has been a slight,improvement in share prices during the last quarter however at the
same time the outstanding debts to our suppliers,have also increased in other words our revenues do not
cover our expenses the situation is serious then,that's right I am afraid we'll need to resort to additional
outside financing i've been calculating the various,balance sheets entries to understand what is causing our debts
and try to develop a plan of attack to get our weak points under control,the results are anything but encouraging as you well know
the solidity and integrity of our financial core,assets are indispensable to keeping our production capabilities intact
and revenues flowing i certainly would not want to be in your,shoes at the meeting no kidding I am predicting lightning and
thunder i wish i did not have to participate,perhaps i could come down with a sudden case of
flu or something how about kidney,inflammation accompanied by high fever caused by a highly contagious
virus mysteriously present in the company,your but now that you will not be here i'll have to double the work by the way
they do not happen to need someone else at the publishing house you were,speaking about so you are a secret author as well no
but i can do a lot of things for example use a computer make photocopies,send faxes that should be enough should not it

so ann how did your meeting with mr stevens and,the montex representative go quite quite well actually it was very
interesting did they come to any agreement for the,moment montrax is going to print 3 000 copies
of our next series of cookbooks mr stevens wants to give them a,a trial run and see how they work if they meet their deadlines and price
competitively he'll sign on for for larger deals in the future,we are hoping to optimize our work and drive down costs a little and
the publishing market is in a deep crisis,readership is dropping rapidly which is driving down sales at the same time
production costs are increasing because of foreign rights acquisition,as well as distribution costs as a matter of fact i
i have not bought many books recently tell me rachel does this crisis also,affect us here at pilgrim certainly
the negative trends of the market are felt throughout the sector,beginning with those who work in it in any case I am optimistic and I am sure
this is just a passing crisis and that the,publishing sector will soon recover that's probably what what gary wanted to
talk to me about this morning i saw him and he said that he had,something very important to tell me aha
what why are you making that face no it is it is nothing anne,it is just that it is just that i do not trust gary
he has a latin lover and full of himself he chases all of the pretty girls around,here and you are just his latest victim
look rachel I am perfectly capable of looking after myself,i only have a working relationship with gary and that's how it is going to stay
sorry anne i i certainly did not mean to offend you,I am quite aware that you are an intelligent young woman
who can keep men like gary at a distance in any case i just wanted to warn you,I am sure you'll agree with me once you get to know him

going now um by the way what would you,say if i told you i had broken your camera you done
what come on ann I am joking i think work is making you just a,little bit too nervous bye yes uh to be honest
i am a bit worried profits are down eight percent,over the last few months and just yesterday
i read an article in uh in in media world,that confirmed my suspicions forecasts for the publishing market
are are quite pessimistic and the general feeling,is that things are going to continue to go downhill based on current trends the
next five years could see a further drop of 20 percent,if we leave out best sellers and fiction then the entire publishing market has
taken a direct hit or better is in a downward spiral,but what about sales for the moment they are stationary but
we will not be able to improve them in fact we'll have to stop publication of,our encyclopedias of history and art history
with awful consequences for those working on these projects,are you saying that we'll have to lay people off no
no not for the moment but if things continue,like they are we will have to let some of our people go
my god there must be something we can do,to keep from cutting staff I am meeting with uh mr stevens this afternoon to
discuss the situation we are going to focus,on uh new objectives for the company in both marketing and sales
perhaps we will develop a new line of economic paperbacks which might help,sales but the other publishers are already
doing that successfully i think we'll need to develop new,products to encourage new market opportunities
well said billy uh i've already got an idea to suggest,it will not resolve all of our problems but it could
bring about some interesting developments and what might this new,idea be well anna are you in there hey
you I am looking for my friend anne is she with you,and surprise uh and hello come back to earth someone's
looking for you alice uh what are you doing here,well i came to see where you work at could you give me a tour
sorry these are your colleagues with long faces uh you always like this,we need a little fun to lighten things up in here
why do not you invite them to the party this evening,no no no no no really i do not think well today is really not a good time to
be talking about parties why do not you come back some other time,and perhaps warn me in advance perhaps bye-bye alice
yes yes mr jones the collection is,divided into thematic volumes your volume will be the first uh dealing
with starters that's right yes,recipes should be written clearly and precisely

we finish this meeting one last thing we have not found a title,for this series do you have any ideas come on use your imagination

worry about you are a great team I am sure you'll,think of something interesting okay gary did you get that email
problem fixed yes i did uh i set up a new account for you,you only have to create a new username and password
how do i do that I am hopeless with computers,i know you are in fact by now i've lost all hope with you
but you really do need to try to learn i mean,email and internet are indispensable in this day and age
i know i know gary you do not ever get tired of repeating that,i must admit I am a luddite how i miss the days when you wrote letters by
hand and visited the library to do research,everything's changed now i think i've done well
to learn to send and receive emails speaking of emails um i noticed what you,were writing to the authors and if you'll permit me rachel
your emails are much too stuffy and formal,they do not fit in at all with internet jargon what are you saying
i'll give you an example uh when you start off an email,you use we'd like to inform you that it is quite old-fashioned you know it is
better to write did you know that or another example,when you need to make an excuse you begin we regret to inform you that
it is much better to use something like unfortunately we cannot,it is less formal but at the same time more professional
email needs to be kept simple and to the point use abbreviations,as often as possible and keep phrases short if you are writing to someone you
know well you can even add an emoticon it is always,a pleasure to get one an emoticon what the devil is
that you are so old school rachel emoticons are those little faces that,you can make using keyboard characters that
show how you are feeling at the time okay okay professor i'll try to simplify,and use a more colloquial tone when writing
perhaps i'll even put in a smiley it is not difficult you'll see just let,the magic of the internet transport you but remember to use netiquette you are
talking like a computer manual what is netiquette it is good manners,on the internet it is the rules of the road of the network
rachel rachel rachel you really do need to get some practice do not you,i've got an idea why do not you let me sign you up for a forum
that way you can learn the rules of the road and the lingo as you surf,speaking of which do you like music music yes very much so
great then i'll add podcasting sites to your favorites,so you can download podcasts and maybe even burn them to disk and stop

and this is mr richardson how do you do good morning,and i see you have had your hair done very nice
thank you mr stevens it looks like you were out late last,night i hope you had fun were you

anyway um i do not want to bore you with my personal problems,right so mr richardson tell us about your
typographical services then founded by charles emerson montex,has been active in the typographic market since
1985 from the beginning we have been known for our innovation,and high quality products mr emerson's children john and lucy have
continued the tradition by improving and enlarging the family,business the first montage office was located
in russell street russell street that's where the flower market is i went,there just the other day and bought two beautiful yellow
orchids I am sorry I am sorry mr richardson i i did not mean,to interrupt you um as i was saying over the years
and following changes in the market our company has diversified and extended,its line of products we have purchased the latest technology
offering our customers the best package available on the market today,in 2000 we moved to a larger office space
in order to improve production and new headquarters are located in rodney road,and we have approximately 55 000 square meters at our disposal
well that's a huge space yes that's right,it is very big anyway our first success was with
brochures marketing flyers pamphlets and company catalogues we also provided,business cards and general printing services
over time we moved into book publishing as digital technology,and expansions in the market gave us the skills to enter the market
currently we are equipped to provide highest quality publishing,at an extremely competitive price a current capacity is more than 100
million pages per year so ann have you understood everything,would you like to sum up what mr richardson has said
me yeah could you um all right i'll try,established in 1985 by charles emerson montex has successfully grown and
adapted to changing client needs in 2000 the company transferred to,rodney road where thanks to cutting-edge equipment capable
of high volume it has optimized its production and,extended its offerings specializing in the publishing sector
currently it provides top quality printing at extremely,attractive pricing well done you have a great ability to
summarize you know mr richardson we are not very,pleased with our current typographers they do not meet deadlines
professionalism efficiency and punctuality are the keys to our,success do you know that in just a few years the
number of montex clients has grown by 100 and what sort of printing do you,principally use digital printing and offset printing in the case of high
density needs what offset,printing young lady you work for a publishing house
and you do not know what offset printing is,um no sir I am afraid i do not is it important and offset printing
is the classic way in which a graphic project done on a computer is converted,to the final printed page i get it i get it well it is important it is
extremely important what an idiot i must seem,i basically told you i have no technological know-how

text,jack jack i was waiting for you have you
got a minute sure edward what is up you want to put some muscles in your film,jack you are are quite a joker i need some advice about a rather delicate
matter well it is about women well then you have come to the right person,when it comes to women you know all modesty I am sort of an expert go ahead
shoot but make it fast i have to get to the gym well do not worry it is like,this if a woman lets you mysteriously know that she has keen on you and if you
did not expect it but then you find that you do not mind the gesture in fact,because of this you find that you are becoming fond of her and if she acts as
if nothing has happened whoa whoa whoa edward what do you getting at i i do not,understand it is this a new idea for a film because if it is you should think
about rewriting this script it seems very convoluted to me jack stop joking,it is a serious matter i i just do not know how to behave i i cannot stand this
situation well okay let's take this from the,top so a woman goes for you however she does not do it
openly but then she pretends as if nothing is happened and as far as i can,tell you do not dislike the idea have i got it exactly what should i
do well the fact her behavior leads me to believe,that she has fond of games so use that
play the mysterious man and then surprise her with something special you,know like uh take her out to dinner or write her a poem or send her some red
roses women really go for that kind of thing,really i got an idea
great this spot should work well maybe here would be,better and i'll put the card here next to
this let's give it a quick once over again,and i should have done this long ago now i cannot wait any
longer listen to my poetry written especially for,you you are perfume the color of all
flowers the breath and scent of the sea the worming strength of the sun,you the shining star that lights my
life who knows if she'll like it what about these,roses will she like them and what if she makes fun of me
perhaps i should not have listened to jack but of course of course it makes no,sense to go on as if nothing has happened somebody has to take the first
step i'll await you tomorrow night,here in the living room when everyone is asleep we'll be
able to be alone finally,alone okay that is done there's nothing more to do now but
wait and i'll be home soon thank god alice will not be here at least for 2 hour,and jackie is at the gym yes i calculate everything perfectly now it is time for
me to leave as well i do not want him to see me,here here she is it is time to
go excellent great edward the moment of truth,approaches they'll never call me an amat again
right fine bye-bye always the door open bloody,cats what are these for
me they are beautiful i wonder who sent,them what
poetry who could have written it no no,man what are you thinking now do not be silly it cannot have been
jack my god then again he has the only person i,can imagine who would have written such lovely poetry
and my god what if it were jack,now that sharon is out of the picture and who would have ever thought that but
one day,jack hi an hi alice my are not we feeling chirpy today yes we are feeling
chirpy i've just received a mysterious and completely unexpected surprise so,what is it what is all the suspense for I am sorry
alice i'd like to keep it a secret for the time,being there's something i have to check up on first but do not worry i'll tell
you soon enough now why do not you tell me how is,it going with edir hard by the look on your face i would
guess things are not going very well you said it a complete and utter,disaster i should never have written that
card why what is the matter that's the problem nothing has,happened edward acts as if he'd never read that card and yet i know he read it
I am absolutely certain of why are you so sure well he told me in,no uncertain terms i fished around vaguely and he admitted that something
strange had happened and he also said that he was very,pleased and then nothing no words no actions at this point i think he was
referring to something else entirely or else i just have to accept,the fact that he is not interested in me do not get depressed
alice if you want my opinion i think you should have told him in,person face to face is always better than playing
games at any r you have still got time why do not you sit down and have an,earnest word with him no way to be embarrassed further
anyway there's something fishy about this whole story either edward is acting,like a complete fool or else he has not truly understood what i feel for
him i need some clarity from now on I am going to,scrutinize his every
move hi I am so happy you have accepted my,invitation what a strange voice you have i almost would not have recognized you is
that real you cannot imagine how i've longed for this moment really you,do not say to be truthful I am rather emotional
myself I am glad you feel that way so down boy i i really do not want to wake,the others the others never mind who cares if they find out actually i'd
rather they did not you know how i am I am shy and reserved what a pity i know,and that's why I am crazy about you reserved with the
others but you are a tiger when it comes to what you want come again you know,exactly what I am speaking about well let's light a
candle i want to see your face edward what are you doing,here it is me do not worry our date you do not

have to explain i know how things are i know,that you like me but just as a friend a friend that well maybe if we'd met at
some other time and excuse me things would have gone differently and then,well perhaps blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and can i speak for 1 minute
please yes certainly jack thank you you are right ahead,now you know how how i suffered about
sharon and after her i i did not think i'd ever,feel anything about another woman but then you came back from your
holiday and and and i started to feel better i did not think about sharing so,much what are you getting at jack an it
was it was because of you that that i managed to forget about sharon that's,what friends are for ni p you really do not get it do you get
what jack and,a I am trying to tell you that I am love with
you i i did not want to believe it at first i thought i was attracted to you,because i i felt so alone in the world but then this feeling grew and and when
alice told me about edward i i realized it should have been me to bring you,those flowers jack if this is some kind of a joke it is not very amusing no no no

say she has arriving tonight at 9:00 for,good and she has bringing a surprise wow well that is good
news what together again all for one one for all is not that great,an yep and fantastic what is the matter why the sad face
nothing well it is just that i was just thinking about the poor house i do not,even want to start to imagine what a mess I am going to have in here with you
two,I am
edward stop put that infernal gadget away,that's enough there's a limit to everything you know great that's it and
gone like that you are fantastic fantastic my eye i told you to cut it,out alice alice yes an what can i do for
you stop laughing and tell your director friend to to give,it a rest and put away that damn video camera i absolutely do not want to be
filmed like this have i made myself perfectly,clear hi alice hey good morning edward cannot stop working eh what is on the menu
for today's shoot wow an you look,beautiful excuse me um could i use the bathroom for a
moment thanks just calm down and none of these sessions are going to be shown,for air at least for now what exactly does for now mean well
once all the material has been put in place cut and edited edward's planning,on showing it to a producer if it is accepted the idea is to go for our own
tv program is not that a great idea what yeah,producer television let me in jack let me in no
let me in let me,in so an
what do you think of edward in what sense as a man or as a director do you,really have to ask as a man of course well i've just met him so i cannot
really say but um as a director my view is that he has a bit too,intrusive come on and get over it that's his job in my opinion i think he has just
great m what is this I am,hearing our little alice might be in love well
yes as i see it and this is the first time in my life i've fallen head over,heels in love so much in love but he does not even notice me you
know we share so many common interests and with we see things in the same way,we can talk for hours on end but it just ends there he looks on me as a good
friend nothing more nothing less you know I am really not used to that role,usually I am the one to keep others aa yes i remember um tom frank david how
many broken hearts have you left behind so tell me,have you asked edward how he feels about you no of course not look edward is not
interested in some relationship he has he has profound and,introspective spiritual he has a person who enjoys
observing and analyzing others yes if you ask me too much,so anyway i cannot agree with you I am afraid
even spiritual beings personal longings i think you should tell him and who,knows your edward might be much more human than you think maybe you are
right but i have to think of a special way to show him just how i,feel maybe i should see what my horoscope has to
say yes yes yes i've just had a brilliant,idea alice h are you feeling okay yeah hi an
I am just preparing a little lunch for edward,edward what is with the french accent i thought you said he was
canadian he is from the french part his mother's french so he has fully,bilingual well now that you mention it i had noticed a slight french accent

housewife well to tell you the truth i have not got used to it yet you know i,just hope i got the recipe right you know i followed the instructions to the

okay no it is not okay we have to speak about the,situation and clear the air once and for all i've been thinking about us a
lot i've been thinking about it so much i i have not slept well in,nights what have you been thinking jack about
us you are leaving for japan i've told you before and i'll tell,you again sharon it is crazy you cannot leave now when when we
know how we feel jack you are repeating yourself,that's right and i'll continue repeating myself
until you accept the truth,we are made for each other stop it you are embarrassing
me sharon listen i have not stopped loving,you and i know you feel the same about me that's it i said stop it and i meant
it look you made me cry and anyhow how do our feet feelings,change anything how do they change anything
they they change everything you must tell peter,immediately about everything tell him you will not
go I am so happy i knew you felt the same way about,me hey is anyone in there my god it is
peter he he cannot see me like this stay calm maybe it is time we tell him,everything jack
sharon what are you doing here i've been looking for you for half an,hour hey what is the matter you have been crying
are you going to explain to me what is going on or not peter listen calm down,I am not going to calm down i want answers and i want them now what is going
on here that's what i'd like to know jack and sharon have been here for who,knows how long and who knows what they have been
doing hey jack it is time you tell me what is up I am,going to get really mad if i do not get some
answers okay stop stop you are acting like little,children come on jack let's leave peter and sharon
alone they need to talk and and we need to go,shopping so shanon what is going
on peter i have to tell you something i've never told you,before i've known jack for a long time we went to the same university
together and well we were once engaged,what so that's why jack came to live here you have been seeing other have not
you shan no peter i swear it is true we just happened to meet him here it,happened by chance by chance that's a strange stroke of
luck just enough to bring back some old passionate,feelings there's how long has this been going on
sharon nothing has happened between jack and,i even if i do still have some feelings for
him after all peter you have been neglecting me for,months the only thing that's important to you is your
work you live eat and drink theater and nothing else so you are saying this is my,fault no one is at fault it is just that we want different
things from life at the moment i've had two interviews with the,director of the archaeology museum they want to open an art
exhibition and they have offered me a job do you understand,peter it means a job i would really love what are you getting at
sharon would you stay here and not go to japan if i asked you what kind of,question is that answer me peter it is
important i've accepted the job without asking me how could you and did you ask,me about japan did you peter
huh are you willing to stay here with me i uh i cannot,sharon this is my big chance you see peter I am
right nothing is more important to you than your,success so it is just you and me is not it an
well really it is just me all alone are you still,angry no i was just joking of
course it'll be difficult to forget a man like you you are just pulling my leg,now are not you an i wanted to say
if it had been a a different time in my life or if,there weren't sharon maybe we
would or rather maybe we,could too many ifs jack anyway I am happy for both you you
and sharon,really you know i adore love stories with happy endings hey do not jump to
conclusions sharon just left peter okay let things take their natural,course you know as alice would say if she were here i really miss her
craziness and her jokes the house just is not the same,without her that's true she always had something to
say i i miss so many,things like peter i even miss his singing exercises but they were awful
our poor ears i know but i was used to,them by the way how did things turn out in the end between you
two pretty well well we we had a long talk,and he understood it really was not my fault that it was
inevitable peter was just too involved with his career to notice sharon's needs,and desires let's just say i took advantage
of their situation i'd say,so you have never met missed a chance like that in your life have
you it is late i have to,go I am late as usual by the way sharon and i are going
to see a film tonight would you like to,come thanks for the invitation jack um but uh i i'd prefer to stay
home anyway a possible new flatmate is coming to take a look at the apartment,and well his name's nick well actually i' i've got to get
things tidied up that's right cleanliness is next to,godliness huh do not work too hard
an perhaps nick is less tidy than alice,and i put together no i lost the battle with you two but
it is time to put an end to all this chaos i'll ask him all the right,questions and but if i get the feeling he does not like cleaning i will not let him
in the door hi sharon,could i speak to you for a moment sure
peter I am listening you know i thought a lot about,what you told me
well i have to admit you are right i have not been paying very much,attention to you i will not be angry if you do not want
to stay with me,peter do not worry about me just look forward to your
musical it is your big break is not it if you weren't so committed you,would not be the man for the job now would
you you are a star right yes i,know it just is not easy imagining japan without
you it will not be easy for me either but I am sure it is the right,decision for both of us i hope so if i were rich and famous already i'd
send along my private jet so you could visit me on weekends yeah,right the petrol alone would cost you your fortune who cares i'd be
rich so while i wait for you to bring your,career off and become rich i might come visit you maybe with
an but if you are famous you'll forget all about,me you'd let it go to your head and would not have time to take care of
me i couldn't keep up with all those beautiful young,actresses how could i forget you sharon by the
way would you mind me taking that beautiful photo of you,along to japan with me the one hanging in the living
room it'll help me when i missing you especially in the,beginning of course peter take
it i'll be happy to give it to you thank you well i have to get on with,packing one last thing if we were to meet in a few
years in two apartments close to each other you with your new,boyfriend would you pretend not to know me like you did with
jack why do you ask me that i do not know just,curious i guess it would be fun to meet you you somewhere else and have a little
secret between us two,okay sharon you remembered to buy the beer right of course i did and you
managed to bake the cake right not yet I am going to bake it this,afternoon i still need to get some chocolate actually jack offered to get
some for me he promised to bring some before lunch sorry but i cannot help you,with the cake i have to take some tourist to visit the tape gallery
do not worry about it i'll have jack to help me he decided to stay home today to,give me a hand just do not forget to tell tom david
mary and all the others do not worry peter said he'd take care of it I am sure,he has already got in touch with everybody by
phone great everything is going as planned do not forget to buy the,present do not worry how about getting an astrology book she'd love that
absolutely she loves reading those kinds of,books i hope i can get it before i go to work by the way have you heard anything
from mr dubois well he told me he expected to come but couldn't confirm,but you know how it is being so busy and everything it is it is hard for him to
give a definite answer one way or the other i imagine being a stage director,is difficult alice will be so happy if he
comes yes she will anyway mom's the word if you say,anything it will not be a surprise hey everyone what are you up to
nothing important i almost forgot happy,birthday alice so what have you arranged to do this evening well i considered
celebrating with you guys i mean if you want to I am really sorry but well,jack has arranged to eat out this evening with his colleagues and he cannot

kimberly it is a pleasure I am jack hello jack ann has told me so much about you,hi I am ellis you live in rome do not you so how is life in bella italy wonderful
my father raised me in america though but italy is the most fascinating,country in the world as far as I am concerned its history the art and of
course the best food in the world what else could anyone ask for and and of,course the italians are the most likable people in the world you are 100% right
just look at me I am originally from bolognia which is,one of the best cities in the world when it comes to eating well i know bolognia
well it is a beautiful city even if i do prefer rome rome is much bigger and more,exciting so how does london compare london is not that bad apart from the
weather it certainly is much colder than in italy and the british are well how,should i say this they are less clever than the italians watch yourself jack
watch what you are saying yes you know kimberly and i are both british well I am,more british than she is you are right well i was talking about british men of
course kimberly this is peter and sharon they live in the apartment,next door it is a pleasure to meet you so kimberly an told us that you are
attending art school in rome you know i wanted to study art when i was a little,girl but in the end i decided to study archaeology instead that's
interesting and peter what do you do I am an actor and i u do a little singing I am,acting in a musical at the moment what a great career yes but it is certainly less
stressful than jack's line of work he works a lot harder than peter,but actually he has the hardest working person in the house and I am the person
that has the most fun speaking of fun what shall we do this evening i would,love to go out it is been so long since i last came to london well why do not we go

discipline in this house you cannot do what you want all the,time we need some rules do not roll your eyes while I am
speaking to you okay okay an you are right rules are,important but it is also important to laugh a little
ha haa hi everybody what is on,tv jack just a minute it is almost finished excuse
me,so what were you watching that was so
engrossing it was an extremely interesting documentary about picasso's,life there were lots of details about some of his stranger habits did you know
that picasso preferred painting women with four eyes no i had no idea and that,he had lots of different types of dogs he used to give only dogs to his friends
strange is not it and that he liked eating italian cake at,christmas well i also go crazy for italian cake at christmas and my name
is not picasso by the way where is our resident,artist alice she left early this morning she said that she had something in
important to do she would not tell me what but she did say it was none of my,business you know how she is that's strange she usually leaves
late well as a matter of fact she was very serious this,morning she told me she had a headache but i did not believe
her look but it is getting,late I am starting to get
worried do not play mom in alice is a big girl now i know i know but it is just,that but she did not tell me she would be late in fact she asked me if i would be
late today just a moment a few days ago alice told me that she wanted to enter a,painting contest she said she thought it was her big
chance maybe that's where she is today,well you are probably right
but but it it is almost midnight i do not think contests last,that long why not we all know that artists are a little
crazy picasso was a perfect example that's true you know something,about being crazy jack do not you
good morning alice where were you last,night we were getting worried good
morning i prefer not to talk about it why what,happened well i took part in a young artist competition i thought it would be
the perfect occasion for for me to show my,talent so how did it go you made a great
impression did not you well no it went,badly they said that i was not cut out to be an
artist but the jury was made up of incompetence maybe no one appreciates my,talent come on now alice do not take it so
badly you know you are a genius right that's all that,matters yes just like van goof who by the way only became famous after he had
died maybe that's my destiny maybe you are exaggerating just a,little bit i mean van
go but you do not really think you are in the same league do you and why not no,one appreciates my talent either anyway i want your opinions wait
just a moment while i get,something my goodness here you
go this is the painting i took along yesterday what do you,think is not it beautiful
it is it is interesting um it is a very a very unique painting,yes unique is the right word uh alice you know i do not really understand art
do not you what does it,represent that's the same question they asked me
yesterday i cannot believe that it is so clear it is a painting of a man and a,woman walking hand in hand
i see mhm um well the truth is uh it is a bit,difficult to see i mean at first glance it looks like a
whole lot of mixed up colors come on jack you just do not,understand abstract art do you well now i understand that neither of
you has any appreciation of fine,art artists never tell an artist what you
really think I am the only child in my family,how many children do you want to have i was invited to his birthday party

japan moving to japan what does sharon have to do with,peter's musical anyway well you know how it is jack when two people are together
they make changes together and anyway why do you care if peter and sharon move,to japan i do not care but i really do not think that

frivolous than i am alice come on guys do not argue now,please let's vote on it well alice and i want to go dancing peter and an do not

paradise it is a new disco on king's road it is very nice did tom and you go there,together yes we went last saturday we spent a nice night together
together maybe i asked the wrong question you do not like tom do you he has,boring very boring besides he has in aries and he
talks too much last night for example he showed me all the pictures of his,holiday in the alps he talked for an hour about the mountains but i hate the
mountains why do you say that the mountains are beautiful and,spectacular i prefer the beach it is more relaxing and
entertaining i do not know i think the beach is more boring than the mountains,why do you say that well think about it lying on the beach every day it is much
more interesting to be walking in the countryside,yes but it is usually colder in the mountains i think the beach is also more
romantic girls stop talking nonsense how do i look you look very,pretty alice thanks sharon but you look better
than me no how can you say that you are much more tan than i am yes but you are,in better shape and
me how do i look you are very very pretty too,an I am sure I am not nearly as beautiful as
you come on guys stop making stupid comparisons let's just say that we are,all different hey girls okay are you ready i
need your advice which shirt is better according to you the red one it is much,better than the blue one for a disco night and you sharon what do you think
well i think the red one is funnier while the blue one is more,professional i prefer the blue one so girls which shirt should i put on
i told you the red one with that one on you'll look more,macho yes macho that's the right word really macho i like it okay i'll put on
the red shirt do you agree with alice sharon,about being macho i mean come on jack it is late the disco is waiting for

have you had breakfast remember this is a break,that when break and fast together we pronounce as
brec okay why i do not know okay break and this,is a break breakfast breakfast breakfast have you had breakfast have
you had breakfast number three let's take a,break let's take a break let's take a break
that means let's take a rest okay so we stopped,working let's take a break have a tea have a
coffee okay chat with each other for a little,bit and then we can come back to study or come back to work okay
break let's take a break let's take a break let's take a break,quite strange huh this is break and this is
breakfast number four would you you can link them together would you,would you like to eat cereal would you like to eat cereal
would you like to eat cereal that means do you want to eat cereal,her sister remembers sis her sister really
likes beef steak beef steak beef steak and,beans okay this is e a long e beans and this is egg okay beef steak
you can lick them together beef steak beef steak convinced her sister really,likes beef steak convinced one more time she has my teacher
have you had breakfast let's take a break,would you like to eat cereal her sister really likes beef steak and beans
now number one and from number one to number three the,shirts are too small for my
daughter to wear i am too young to,drive a car this cup of tea is too
hot for me to drink you can easily find out the grammar structure right,the shirts or eye of this cup is the subject r
m or is that is b to b,to and that is two small young or hot
adjective for my daughter here no for somebody,for me so you can act for somebody if you like and then
two to where to try to drive a car to drink so after that is,two infinitive infinitive that means the base form of
the verb or we do not add s e s e d,or in here just keep the base form of the verb so
two and then the infinitive now from number four to number six,we would find out another grammar structure
the book seemed too boring for us to read,i think your son looks too short to play basketball
the noodles taste too spicy for her to eat,the book i think i think it is not important
the subject here is your sun and then the noodles so the subject,first and then seemed looks
taste as you can see they are not to be they are verbs,but they are not normal verbs normal verbs used to describe
action you know study run joke listen but,this one seems looked taste they are linking verbs
linking verbs do not describe actions they describe state or feeling,usually relates to five senses you know eyes ears
nose eyes or your hands so we have the linking verbs,look hear smell taste and feel number seven
to number nine the teacher spoke too,fast for the students to understand she studied too lazily
to pass the sorry the final exam my brother,runs too slowly to catch me up the teacher
she my brother the subject after that spoke you know past simple of,speak study run
so i like to be other linking verbs they are,normal verbs so verb subject verb they you know spoke
study and runs they describe actions so they are normal verbs and then,two two two two and then now after two fast
lazily slowly are they adjectives no they are adverbs,so remember after verb adverbs now and then for the students here
no for somebody no okay so you can act for somebody if you like and,then to understand to pass
or to catch so after that is two infinitive 2.,text

thailand thailand has many inland and coastal resorts i already know about,many of the resorts in southern thailand what about the rest of the country
central thailand has beautiful rivers and waterfalls and there are mountains,and lush forests in the north the thai scenery certainly does sound fantastic

then lets you know okay no problem I am here to offer any advice when you need,it thank you ever so much good bye good bye
hello i'd like some advice please sure how can,i help you I am on vacation but I am only here for a few days
i'd like to know what tours do you recommend okay,are you looking for a day excursion to some local attractions an overnight trip
or perhaps a weekend getaway i'd like to stay fairly local i think,because i've already done a lot of traveling in that case may i suggest
that you look through this brochure and see if there's anything there that,interests him thank you kanchana berry looks interesting i see that you have to
package tours to canterbury can you give me the price of each one certainly the,day trip costs one thousand three hundred baht and the overnight trip
costs two thousand four hundred but it looks like there's a lot more items,included on the two-day itinerary so i think i'll choose that one okay i will
make the reservation for you it is a really good tour so I am sure you'll,enjoy it thank you besides the bangkok attractions can you
tell me what other day trips are available certainly the two most popular,excursions are to a your ta intention amore yes that's where the famous bridge
over the river kwai is is not it that's right we offer trips to the,bridge and also the death railway where thousands of allied troops were killed
by the brutal treatment of the japanese during its construction what else is,there to see in kunshan every most in the province remains specially populated
and wild so there are a number of wildlife sanctuaries i'd like to go see,what the real thai countryside looks like yes you should the landscape is so
picturesque kanchanaburi has several of thailand's largest waterfalls they,are beautiful okay I am sold when can i go
unit 5 thai customs this is my first trip to thailand and i'd like to find,out some information about thai customs ok the first thing you should know is
the thai greeting yes i've seen that when thais greet each other they put,their hands together in a prayer position that's right it is called the y
and thai people do it to show respect for each other that's interesting we,just shake hands yes and most thai people know that so no one will be angry
with you if you do not lie however if someone does y to you then it is only,polite to return the greeting is that the only time of y is performed no thai
people also show respect to images of the king and lord buddha in the same way,although when the y is performed on these occasions the hands are held
higher and the head is bowed lower the gesture can mean not only hello but also,thank you goodbye and I am sorry wow i did not know that
thanks for your advice i heard that thai food is very delicious is it very spicy,thai food is wonderful but a lot of our dishes are made using chilies so be
careful especially if you are not used to hot food is it possible to eat food that,is not very spicy yes there are a number of dishes that are not too spicy look out
for dishes that are made using coconut milk those tend to be less spicy is,there any thai food i should watch out for my advice is to try everything but
do be careful if you buy food from a street vendor they are not governed by,the health authority so the food might not be as clean or
prepared as the food you would get in a restaurant thank you you have been very,helpful no problem what do traditional thai
homes look like well traditional homes were made from teak they had ornate,roofs and were usually built on stilts nowadays most people live in modern
houses or apartments what should i do if I am invited to a thai house thai people,are very hospitable so it is not unusual to be invited into someone's home are
there any do's and don'ts well you must remember to take your shoes off at the,door that's the most important thing what should i expect you probably be
offered something to eat and drink a glass of water a cup of coffee some,fruit whatever is at hand really but what if I am not hungry or thirsty you
should try something to refuse even a taste might be considered impolite thank,you that's good advice - no you are welcome unit six shopping
can you tell me the best place to go shopping there are many places you can,buy inexpensive gifts and souvenirs from department stores and shopping malls to
markets and street vendors what kind of things should i buy traditional thai,handicrafts include cotton and silk weaving i definitely want to buy some
silk do you have any other suggestions paper parasols and wood carvings are,other popular gift items if giving me some very useful yes thank you what is
the best market to go to the best one here in bangkok is the justit's a,freaking market is that the biggest yes it is huge you can buy just about
anything there and what about the floating market bangkok used to have,many floating markets until they started to fill in the canals there are still
several around but some of them are now just tourist shows probably the most,authentic one is the demands of the work floating market is that worth going to
certainly there are pictures of floating markets everywhere around thailand and,the trip to bangkok would not be complete without a look at one do you have any
advice for my visit to the market today hmm be prepared to barter you can get,some real bargains but watch out the vendors will start by asking a high
price for their goods you can usually knock them down a lot though hmm,that could be fun is there anything else i should know it is very hot so make sure
you drink plenty of water thank you i will there is one more thing it is very,crowded and there may be pickpocket around so be careful with your wallet
okay thanks for the advice unit seven religion if you are going to,visit any temple then there are a few things you should know yeah go ahead
well temples are sacred places so you should dress politely okay what kind of,things should i avoid wearing you should not wear shorts or sleeveless tops
and you may be refused admission if you are not wearing shoes with closed,heels and toes make sure you take your shoes off though before you go inside
i'll remember that is there anything else just be careful not to tread on the,doorframe when you step inside and if you sit down then do not point your feet
towards the buddha can i kneel or sit cross-legged yes either spine the most,celebrated architectural form of thailand is the what the thai buddhist
temple complex so the wat is comprised of more than one,building yes a what is made up of several buildings that serve all the
religious needs of the monastic community there seem to be a lot of,"temples in thailand there are thailand has nearly 18,000 buddhist temples"
throughout the country wow that's a lot well the temples provide religious,sanctuaries for thailand's buddhists who account for about 95 percent of the
population the temples are covered with the most beautiful paintings we are very,proud of them the mural paintings are one of thailand's great artistic
achievements do they all depict similar stories well all the scenes are inspired,by buddhist doctrines and are usually intended to teach the worshippers about
religion and morality i've seen miniature temples next to people's,houses what are they for ah there's spirit
houses every tight house or building has one so people believe that spirits live,in them yes thai people believe sacred spirits live
in their houses the spirits are called pappu they make special spirit houses,for pappu to live in i spend some type evil putting flowers and things inside
the family paid their respects to pop him at the spirit house so the spirits,will protect the family and bring good fortune thank you that's very
interesting we have nothing like that back home unit 8 bangkok's detractions,when was the grand palace built king

thanks i'll have a diet coke where exactly is it,I am sorry i did not catch that okay how far is it okay okay
missy what any luck i think i found an apartment how do i,get to belleville the easiest way is to get the metro at pyramids take line
fourteen and change at chatelain okay then take line eleven towards mary,delilah where do i get off at dell villa and how many stops is it six i think
right i found it on the map how long does it take to get there about that's,an hour have you found a flat yeah in belleville
this time when are you going to see it this afternoon if you can wait till 6:00,i'll give you a lift i live near belleville so I am driving
that way that's great thanks thank you,this is the apartment visit a just
rather merci madame sorry nicole what did she say she said we can have a look,at the flat she has going to wait downstairs thanks
so what do you think it is a long way from the station and it is on the fourth,floor it is a pity there is not a lift who needs
one the stairs are good exercise look there's a great view from here it is,also very noisy sure but it has character
it is just how i imagined an apartment in paris everything's old including the,heating it would be very cold in the hotel
hi well what is it like nice really parisian are you going to take it i,think so yeah i cannot wait to see it yeah are you okay are you on your own no
I am with the woman who owns the apartment i'll call you back okay,speak later love you love you too bye sorry about that that was that was
my my daughter calling from america you know she has just taking an interest,taking an interest that's nice i got a message this morning it is from
jacques ali its jack I am in rome my return flights been canceled there's a,small problem scarlet's cappy no is in paris for her
concerts of this evening i was going to look after her today could you possibly,take care of her thank you and see you later
you have met scarlett scarpino have not you been the punk princess yeah i met her in,london last year what is she like let's say she has a bit difficult what are we
going to do with her why do not you show her around paris i have a better idea,why do not you show her around paris what me I am new here you cannot leave me to do
this on my own okay why do not we take it a no-trade um i mean it is her first time,in paris is not it i do not think churches are really her thing how about taking
her on a boat trip brilliant and then we can go up the eiffel tower that's a good,idea I am sure she'll love the view and she might fall off thanks for your help
ben shall we have lunch after that let's go somewhere really nice do you have any,recommendations ben what about la renascence
as sharks favorite that sounds perfect ben do you want to come to you sorry,allie I am really busy but I am sure you'll have an unforgettable meal
so scarlett what would you like nothing are not you hungry sure but this foods,really horrible this is one of the finest restaurants in paris
well i cannot eat this stuff i never touch meat the seafood looks good hey,fish have feelings too what about the mushroom risotto mushrooms no way
did not they tell you guys about my allergies I am allergic to mushrooms,strawberries nuts shall we go someplace else whatever I am
going to the restroom well that was a disastrous morning the,boat trip made her feel sick and she would not go up the eiffel tower i cannot
stand heights it is a pity we did not just take her shopping she has so spoiled,come on she has just a kid really so what are we going to do about lunch
shall we leave now no hang on i have an idea let me talk to the waiter monsieur,do you think you could possibly do me a favor yes of course so would you like
well i think this place is great more wine alley no thanks,what is this it is your lunch scarlet but i did not order anything
hey pizza margherita cool that was a great concert last night scarlet thanks,as we know scarlett's got a new cd coming out soon so let's have a look at
the best way we can promote it in france okay well i think scarlet should visit,the major music stores in my opinion that's the best way to meet her fans I am
not so sure what do you think jack actually i do not agree with mark scarlet,is not commercial in that way scarlet scarlet i agree with jacques i
do not have a commercial image it is not my style okay but scarlet needs more,publicity what about a series of tv and radio interviews do not you agree
yes well that's what everybody does what we want is something different,personally i think scarlet should tour clubs and summer festivals she can dj
play her favorite music play the new cd and meet her fans too yes absolutely,that's a much better idea mark okay why not
scarlet i think that's a great idea thank you doc it is,great to be on my own again yeah that's the first time you have been to the loo
uh-huh what is the matter is this about the,meeting because i agree to the jack and not with you yeah well we knew it
would not be easy working together i mean it is difficult for me as well but if i,do not agree with you i know i know you are the boss and i have to do my job
i really thought that jack's idea was better and so did scarlett it is not a,big deal allie I am fine really so who exactly was the mona lisa I am not
sure i think she was the wife of a banker it is that way she has smiling,because her husband has a good salary i also read somewhere that she was a
self-portrait of leonardo a self-portrait you are kidding,now i do not know much about art but leonardo da vinci was a man right well
it is just a theory why do you think she has smiling well in my opinion she has,the managing director of a music company what she lives in paris she has in love
with her marketing director and she has a lot of fun telling him what to do,that's really unfair hey we are not in the office now you
cannot tell me I am wrong let's get a coffee good idea,do not turn around what is it i've just seen ben from the office
yeah i said do not look i do not think he has seen us let's get out of here come,on yeah you'll never guess who i saw on saturday no allie and mark in the
louvre together really you are joking it was definitely then and they looked,really close i think they were holding hands no i do not believe it it is true
I am telling you and i think they saw me because they turned and left really,quickly are you serious you know I am not surprised
i think they have been seeing each other ever since mac arrived,maybe even before that's incredible what makes you say that when i wait to
look at marks new apartment I am sure ali called em on his mobile and i've seen,her looking at him a often away hey quiet everyone
it is mark dear all please find attached a copy of,the latest sales report from the usa mark so did you guys have a good weekend
yes fine not bad very quiet what about you muck i spent most of the time at,home just being domestic you know the apartments looking pretty nice now you
must come around for a meal one evening that would be very nice so did not you go,out at all sure i went to the louvre on saturday i felt like getting a bit of
culture on your own yeah i kind of prefer going to museums and galleries on,my own you can look at everything at your own pace that's funny i went to the
louvre on saturday - really i did not see you but it is a big place i did not see,you either i just had an email family so have i me
too dear mark thank you for the information and thank you darling for a,wonderful weekend ally mark ryder sure

nobody messes with gary fenton and gets away with it,our hero
have you had a good run yes thanks you have been doing a lot of training,lately yes i thought i'd enter the london
marathon wow do you know where the pen for phone,messages is i've been using it to do the crossword
sorry i know it should not be moved from the phone,leave those i'll seat them in a minute and i have not finished with those yet
it is sunday morning rebecca relax okay,I am going to have a shower
hello sean how are you not too bad i suppose,jason and kylie what have they been doing
now they have been talking on one of those telephone chat lines,you know where you can talk to people from all over the country
we got the phone bill yesterday i do not know what we are going to do with,those kids you could try strangling them i'll bet her your sister phone just now
she'd like you to call her back cindy she never phones me at work,i wonder what she wants could you let me have a report sometime
on the amsterdam conference tim and i particularly like to know whether,you made any useful contacts there sure no problem i'd like to know what
you were up to as well I am sure you would julia,it is very strange i've been living in that flat for four
years and she has only ever visited me once before do you know what she wants,no why do people have to be so mysterious i
do not know why they cannot just say what is on their mind,do not you greet him uh yes
yes definitely you have been tidying this flat for the,last two hours and it was tidy when you started and
that's the fourth time you straightened that pen,what is it with you and your family why does everything have to be so perfect
ever since i can remember cindy's always been better at everything she got better,grades at school she went to university i went to the local technical college
she has got a high-powered job in the city I am just a,secretary a personal assistant but i do not see what that's got to do
with being tidy i've got to show that I am better at something,if i cannot be as successful as her i can be neater or more organized or fitter
is that why you want to do the london marathon,just relax tim and i are going out so i'll be out
of your way soon julia i do not know how to say this,but there's something i need to tell you i suppose you are wondering why i wanted
to go to that conference well,hey you'll never believe this julia but I am thinking of going to work in
australia julia,my love julia i do not know whether you'll like
this but of course she will not like it you nerd,it is no good i'll wait till i hear whether i've
definitely got the job hi rebecca,is cindy still here no she has gone you are right only
you have not cleared the table i've had such a strange evening what,happened you know cindy's always been a
high-powered businesswoman with a flash car and loads of money and now this mba,as well yeah well she has met this guy called jimmy
actually they have been going out for about two years she has not told mum and,dad because they would not approve how romantic and now she has given up her
job what yes,it seems she has been living a lie all her life
she has done all the things she has done just to please mum and dad,wow but you have not heard the best bit
she envies me because i've always done what i wanted,and now she has decided to do what she wants to do too
going to africa yes she and jimmy are going to teach in,a school for blind children she will not make any money doing that
that's the whole point gary so you have been competing with each other all your,lives for no reason yes but we couldn't tell each other how we really felt
you were right the other day julia we should all be more honest with each,other
i thought you'd gone jogging,i've given that up i never really enjoyed it no london
marathon then no i thought i'd just read the paper and maybe do the crossword,could you pass me that pen thanks

and have you thought about it that is i've thought about nothing else since,i would like to marry tim and i would not mind living in australia but well
I am really enjoying my new job and it is sort of like tim wants to go to,australia so my job is not important i just have to give it up to let him do
what he wants to do you'll have to decide what you are going,to do soon though will not you well luckily I am going away tomorrow

well i've thought about you know getting,married yes and
hi tim have you spoken to julia lately her,mobile does not seem to be working she phoned me from her hotel the other night
she told me that she wanted to marry me but she was not going to,she said that i'd only asked her to marry me
to get myself out of a difficult situation she has very upset about it all,you know well she told me that i was going to have to
choose australia or her,hi sean did not it go very well with the
psychologist he told me that kylie and jason weren't,the problem i was
i said i did not spend enough time with them,but i said it was difficult with my job you do work pretty unsocial hours he
asked me what i did so i told him did you tell him that you enjoyed your job,too yeah but he asked me which was more important
my family or my job he said i had to decide what my,priorities were can i speak to julia drake please
checked out okay thank you,hello tim simon
i thought you were in rome i was but i had to come back early martha wants to,talk to me in person and apparently frederick's going to be
there too our managing director is actually here,must be something important are you coming to the pub for lunch

mind your own business it is martha free yet,no she has still with simon and frederick they have been in there all afternoon
martha's free first thing tomorrow morning,it is okay i'll wait sean was here earlier
he told me he'd decided to ask for a transfer to studio work what,he hates working indoors he said it was because the hours were
more regular and if you were going to australia it,was an appropriate time for a change he has here now actually
okay martha's just asked me to find you she,wants you to go in and join them really
is this because of sean's family yes he said he'd realized that the,people he loved were more important than his job
he said it was all a question of priorities,that was a bit of a marathon i did not
see the ghost i would have run a mile if it had appeared,I am exhausted perhaps you should not have tried to do it all in one day maybe
anyway i do not fancy driving back tonight why do not we stay somewhere near,here and then we can go straight into work tomorrow okay i'll ring round some
of the local hotels can i borrow your mobile mine's not working yes of course,you are hi rebecca is julia back yet

hello tim burns what,is she all right the general
yeah I am on my way julia if you are all right what happened,you may well ask tim barnes this is all your fault

going on i was in reception and i heard abigail,saying that you were definitely going to australia
she said that i was going to australia well she did not actually mention your,name but i do not think it is very funny
if that driver had not stopped so quickly julia would have been killed,she was not talking about me she was talking about frederick
I am not going to australia,let me get this straight frederick's going to be managing
director of kangaroo tv and martha's taking over,then simon fletcher is taking martha's place and they have offered me simon's old
job as foreign reporter so as soon as you are well again we can,get married but nothing's really changed has it tim
what do you mean you would not have asked me to marry you,if you had not been offered the job in australia
and you would have gone if simon's job had not come up,no i'd already turned the australian job down i do not believe you
how is the patient look i'll show you,no i put it under your door is
this what you want,you really turned it down i emailed that yesterday before i knew

new acts for the top record companies i could ask him to come along to your,show what do you say
can you ride,maybe an american but I am no cowboy i guess you can
yeah i love it i learned to ride at drama school,he was part of the training you know speaking singing dancing horse riding
right so do you do a lot of acting i wish i actually do a lot of teaching,i've got to make a living sure do you like what you do
well my job yeah,that job's good
there's no need to read the whole thing it is a standard agreement sorry i'll be,back in a minute i just need to have a word with someone
girl trouble hmm,we are meeting at the lobot about 10 so if you'd like to come along hi helen
hi simon see you in here,see you later is he a friend of yours yeah
what are you doing here everything all right,it is all totally above board matt you just have to sign here
uh-huh but what about simon,we only need one signature
and your copy,you will not regret this foreign
well this music thing's become really important to him and i just wanted to,give him some support you mean all the secrecy is because of
matt but why did not you tell me i thought you,were seeing somebody else i know you cannot stand his music
it is not music well eddie thinks it is and you believe him no but matt does and,that's enough for me foreign
you know i have not had this much fun in,a long time me neither
I am getting to really like it here the thing is,i might be going back to the states for work yeah
that's why i had to go back to new york just before you moved into the house,i might be taking on something new it is not definite that they are still
making up their minds hi matt what is up,nothing i was looking for ali
she has still at work is not she yeah right,that does not look too good yeah the chain keeps coming off
right i'll see you then,fine hi
I am off,are you seeing bill tonight yeah but just for a drink nothing serious then
the last thing i need right now is a relationship,especially one where we could be waving at each other from opposite sides of the
atlantic he has probably being transferred to new,york no yes
which is why I am taking a step back we should talk about this later yeah sure,see you bye I am sure the contract's all right but uh
you know what helen's like and she has making simon nervous too you,know I am doing a big favor here yeah i really appreciate it i mean i normally
charge for legal advice and i doubt that you could afford my hourly rate,and you are iggy great
we are not quite ready at the moment uh why do not you take a seat,whatever david
just one thing it is okay to video the candidates is not it candidates,it is not a job interview david as long as you do not use the video for
commercial purposes it is fine that's what i said,that's brilliant thanks for your help david
you know you still owe me the 200 pounds i lent you for jane's tv i have not,forgotten it i'll start paying you back after our gig
you are a real mate okay melissa can you tell us something,about yourself sure
my name is melissa but i guess you all know that by now and i've always wanted,to be a singer in a band in fact i've been in a band and our records have sold
all over the world really,you know i had a number 27 hit in norway and got into the top 100 in luxembourg
and we are pretty successful for about two years,but then it all went wrong our manager was sent to prison he was
really horrible he cheated us out of lots of money,uh-huh but hey we were young and innocent
things happen how young,well i was eight when i joined the band so i guess i was 10 when we split up
right so could you sing something for us now,sure i'd love to i'd like to sing amazing grace
foreign grace how sweet the sun,what do you make of that
is amazing i had no idea he played the piano,it is quite something is not he maybe but like i said he has not for me
come off it jane you are crazy about him we are just having a bit of fun that's,all we are just two ships passing in the
night,well i hope you will not be sending me an sos
that was hopeless ten singers and ten disasters,what about melissa her singing was even worse than yours
she has pretty fit though in an obvious way that does not appeal to,me we could all do with a drink
good idea i played in jazz clubs back home,for a time i even thought about going professional but you know work money
career why do not you sing along,me why not i cannot you are always singing at home
mustang sally foreign,come on do not be shy my baby
guess you better slow you must stand down,all you wanna do is ride around sally ride wow
i think we found you a singer absolutely what if bill does not want to do it bill,you are gonna be wiping those weeping
so you are telling us the contract is,disaster afraid so
what if we decided to ignore the contract,no you could ignore it but my advice is that you would be in big trouble
that's just brilliant why did you sign it,a contract drawn up by a wide boy like eddie usher
what happens if we do the gig david and he'll get all the money I am not,turning up at the galaxy just to line eddie usher's pockets you'd better do
something about that contract or we will not be playing any gigs anywhere okay,i'll think of something yeah right and what about jane
this or not look I am working on it foreign,wow somebody likes you i doubt it
who are they from i do not know there's no card or anything,they are wonderful they must be from bill he likes to send
flowers i'll put them in some water yes,jane hi
hi bill i do not know what i've done to deserve,them but thanks for the flowers the flowers
they are wonderful but not from me they are not no but anyway it is good you,called can we meet up later something's come up and i'd really like to talk to
you about it such as well i really do not want to talk,about it on the phone i'd rather tell you face to face
i'll pick you up seven would that be okay,sure i'll see you at seven bye
it is weird they are not from bill it is eddie,hello eddie I am glad you have called are you that's nice
now listen girls I am a reasonable man but rules are there to be a babe you are,getting behind with your rent and that is not good for anyone why do not you
arrange a standing order with your bank to pay me to rent every month because if,you do that we'll avoid any unnecessary unpleasantness
when you fix the wiring and repaired the water heater we'll pay the rent but not,before that told him at least we know eddie
cannot have sent the flowers you know what,i think it must have been mad perhaps you better call him
could you do it please,is that you matt it is ali sorry ali there was uh something funny
with the line i know this is a bit of an odd question,but did you send some flowers to jane this morning
will she do it what,it was all on the note there was no note no it must have fallen off
i want her to sing with us sing with you well with the band,we need a singer and when we heard jane the other night we thought
well i thought she was brilliant did you so did i you know something,that's a really nice idea i'll have a word with her about it
thanks ellie you are a star bye matt,how about trying something that could really change your life
i cannot believe this it is crazy,you know it is my job if i get caught eddie's the real criminal not us
probably go to prison but if we do not find the contract i'll never be able to,pay you back all your money so let's get started
how are we going to find a contract and all this lot it is like looking for a,needle in a haystack i know have you got it already
no but it is eddie,so what i wanted to say to you was
they have offered you the job in new york that's right,they emailed me this morning and wanted to know how soon
what the hell are you doing in here,legally it is called breaking and entering
you think you are a lawyer that's right and I am representing matt and simon i,would not do that if i were you if you call the police so i'll have to show
them this asha,should i say mr pym or mr de quincy or
senor hector fernandez now the contract for the ban is not very,favorable to my clients i wonder if i might suggest one or two changes
david are you okay couldn't be better listen eddie's agreed,to make changes to the contract has he canceled the gig no the gig's fine also
he has going to be doing some repairs to james flatt,all you need now is a singer a what a singer
yeah I am working on it good the only concession eddie was not,prepared to make was that the lead singer could be you
catch you later bye,bye matt would you mind telling us what is
going on,i've been dreaming of this jane i always knew you'd come back to me
hi how are things,fine listen
can we meet up later i do not know I am not quite sure what I am,doing the thing is
i really need to talk to you and we never really got a chance the other day,what with matt's unexpected arrival we could talk now I am sorry i cannot
right now i've got to go to the office on a saturday,there's loads of stuff i need to sort out you know for the move back to new
york they are really putting me under pressure,to leave as soon as possible right
anyway do you think we can meet up later say,about eight well you can try
do not worry i will i'd like to take you out for dinner,i've been thinking
uh no really what are you going to do about the band,do not you start i've already been sent this
he has a bit desperate is not he well would not you be the cake's in 10,hours you have got to let him know i will i will
it be awful to let him down and it is not just him there's simon there's helen,she has doing everything she can even david's helping out and for no money
why do not you sing with them you know the songs and you have got a fabulous,voice you got to lose you know what the
problem is i just do not want matt getting the wrong,idea anyway
bill wants to take me out for dinner tonight,funny how people think bad news and food go together
i really think you should give matt a break does not he deserve it,deserve it he has put such a lot of effort into this
band and he has tried so hard to put your relationship behind him he is not trying,it on I am sure of it he does not want to get back together with you you seem to
know an awful lot about matt all of a sudden,well we have talked about it that's all one two
one two it is not very original ally it is great to see you,but you are a bit early for the gig i know
i was just wondering if there's anything i could do to help,that's really nice of you i want it to go well
is there any news about jane foreign,she has not coming is she
must have decided to go out to dinner with bill,okay matt it is down to you
everybody gather round,everybody can anyone tell me what is going on
I am just warming up where's your singer,she couldn't make it couldn't make it i've invited important people from the
business i've signed a contract that gives away nearly all my rights and now,you are telling me you have not even got a singer
you are not singing matt no way contract clearly stipulates that you are not,going to sing with the band am i right or am i right
from a strictly contractual point of view you are right eddie we want,we are on minutes
jane,i really care about you you are the best thing that's happened to
me in a long time and i do not want to lose you,well I am not the one who's going to new york you could come with me what
well i do not mean i do not know what i mean i but there,must be a way we can make this work please
I am so sorry i really ought to answer this okay,jane where are you we need you
desperately what is happened and now let me introduce,to you the one and only broken heart featuring eddie asha
thank you eddie you have got to be joking they,did not have a choice wait a moment i need to talk to bill
what is going on is it the gig yes it is a disaster,i've really got to go and sing okay we can sort this out later
ali I am coming,what is up what is going on sorry eddie uh change your plan
what is up what is going on sorry eddie uh change your plan,what is she doing here the contract clearly stipulates that the ban can
choose its own singer provided it is not mad,come on eddie you do not make sense break a leg

last saturday we watched a horror film some of us found it really frightening,she has going to go down the stairs no
do not do it why is she doing that because it is a horror film people always,see stupid things in horror films i cannot watch this
what happened,you killed her really the mother shot it
what a it is load a load of rubbish it is good,fun it was very well made that's just what i was going to say thank you
who wants coffee yes please,simon i'll get it
i would not go in the kitchen if i were you,no no simon do not the ghost
yeah the ghost,actually what
that nothing what david well,there might be a ghost in this house where in the kitchen
what kind of ghost the ghost of a dog do not be silly,it is true i do not know anything about this
well before this house was built,when was this house built about 120 years ago
go on before this house was built there used to be an old cottage here,an old man lived in it and he had a large black dog and everywhere he went
the dog went with him it never left him how do you know all this,one of the neighbors told us anyway the man was killed in an accident
a new family moved into the cottage and the dog was taken away by the old man's,sister but that very first evening yes
the dog went back to the house and started howling,what happened then the owners chased it away but it kept coming back
every night they chased it away every night it came back,and howled and then
well not long after that the cottage was destroyed by a fire and,this house was built ten years later so where's the ghost
well when they were building this house they found a skeleton of a large dog,in the cellar and the neighbor says that sometimes
late at night a dog is heard,howling there's always a logical explanation for
that kind of thing what would you do if you saw a ghost,they do not exist if i saw a ghost i'd run away
if i saw a ghost the ghost would run away,okay simon go make the coffee but do not say i
did not warn you,did you two really hear that story yeah
did you two really hear that story yeah,the others fancy some toast do you want some no thanks
that was a great story who said it was a story,you know the funny thing is what
well although i do not really believe in that,sort of thing yes

this house hi,biscuits matt

30 31 then I am going to become the vice,president of finance and then the ceo by the time I am 40.
maybe 45 yeah yep and when I am 35 or 36,I am going to settle down get married and have some kids

need to have clear-cut well-defined goals and aspirations,i do not know i think you should keep your options open
you know go with the flow,go with the flow eh
so you are not nervous about the promotion i did not say that,it just will not be the end of the world if i do not get it
what about you are you nervous about the new job,not really I am just going to go with the flow
as long as the flow follows my plan,i cannot believe how hot it is out there
why do not we go to hawaii with everyone else,because we did not have the money but
why do we get an air conditioner hello,same reason and quit complaining we have got air
conditioning hi that's a bowl of vice and a fan,takeshi you have got to be more like me and use
your imagination then you too can have a beach vacation,see check out that gorgeous view right but not exactly realistic okay come over
here close your eyes,feel that cool ocean breeze like that's the fridge come on
i said use your imagination now close your eyes,listen to the sound of the seagulls hear the children laughing
why i think i can even smell a barbecue,raw hot dogs do not worry I am gonna cook them up on that grill over there
mike you know you are not allowed to use a girl inside an apartment right,okay uh i'll use the microwave then a beach with a microwave
shirt mike that's the beauty of imaginary beach,we have got a microwave oven we have got a tv with a remote control who could ask
for anything more what about water that's the main reason,people go to the beach what do you use for that the bathtub
no that'd be silly,here we go feel the ocean mist
that's for spring plants not me you know,the sound of the waves the ocean mist
makes me want to surf sir yeah,mike no you cannot stand on that you'll break it no i will not look at me dude I am
hanging 10. cool hey dude watch out for that wave,I am getting the hang of this imagination thing
very funny very funny indeed,well that letter looks official what is
it do you remember how i told you guys that,my uncle died two weeks ago yeah
i was really sorry to hear about him he was the one that you used to hang out,with when you are a kid back in minnesota the guy who lived on that little farm
right yeah well apparently his farm was not so,little i just got a letter from his lawyer
today it seems that uncle max owned all of the,land in the area and he left it all to me in his will
guys I am rich,you are kidding your uncle max was rich yeah but i never knew it what
i never knew he was rich when i was a kid uncle max lived a,really simple life it was not like he was penniless or
anything nothing luxurious he had his farm his old truck and that,was it wow so
what happened did he strike it rich or something no but he always used to tell,me mickey that was his nickname for me
mickey all a man needs is a lot of good land,and a strong back to work it so i guess he must have just worked
really hard or maybe he invested in his land,i do not know whatever he did it paid off and you say he did not have a really
lavish lifestyle you know like swimming pools for his,cows or something no he never seemed to spend any money at all i mean he was
always generous with me offered to give me spending money,even wanted me to go to private school but i said no i thought he was just
being nice last year he called me to see if i,wanted to vacation at his summer house ah
i thought he was just joking turns out he has got one in europe,mike how could you not have known I am telling you this guy never spent money
on anything he never bought anything that was not on sale,he used to have a timer by his phone so that people would not talk too long guys
he would bring home all of the sugar and ketchup packets every time he went to a,restaurant wow and no one knew
i did not in fact i used to offer to give him money when i could no wonder he,laughed at me who would have thought he was that well off
who's well off mike he has rich his uncle left him loads of cash yeah right and,maybe you can pay for dinner tonight that's a great idea i think i'll do that
i'll take you all out to a nice dinner my treat,sounds great um takeshi
I am a little short on cash until uncle max's money comes do you think i could,borrow some I am good for it
and we are talking a nice dinner,tara are you still reading the personal ads
yep you know those ads will never help you,find a relationship yes they will i've already been on three
dates yeah and you are still looking well it is just that i have not found the,right person yet i do not get it you have been on three
unsuccessful dates and you still think it is a good idea why,well for one thing i would not say all my dates have been completely unsuccessful
i may not have met mr wright yet but i've still had fun,yeah but you can have fun anywhere you do not need to go searching through a
newspaper for mr right sonny it can happen my friend karen just,got engaged to a man she met through the personals
and she dated lots of men before she met him and that means,never give up here's one
romantic handsome,well-built male looking for attractive female
for casual dating he has probably a total romeo romantic casual dating there's no,way he has sincere stop it
hey here's one are you attracted to intelligence,do you enjoy a good personality are good looks important but looks
are not everything hmm,good personality looks are not everything sounds like he
might not be too cute why do you say that you have never even,met him well first of all he has writing about his good
personality and intelligence and second of all he has saying that looks,should not be important for the person he dates which probably means he has not that
attractive you are so fussy no wonder you have not,tried dating through the personals yet if you must know
i did answer a personal ad once,yeah what happened we went out for dinner and all he did
was talk about himself and his old girlfriend it was awful,okay that does sound terrible but they are not all bad
maybe you are right let's see what else do you have here,here's one intelligent female seeks interesting
sunday afternoon activity other than sitting at home reading silly personals,really into brad pitt feels like seeing his new movie
all right,let's go
that's beautiful i hope i get that good someday you,will if you stick with it how long have you been playing the
guitar i've been playing since i was a teenager but i've only really been,studying it seriously for about a year how long did you say you have been playing
the flute well like i said i took lessons when i,was a kid but i hated it i started playing about two months ago
and I am really enjoying it this time but like i told you I am not very good,yet well have you been practicing practice makes perfect i practice
sometimes but i have trouble doing it at home,tara and son he have both been studying a lot lately and they keep telling me
they need peace and quiet so there's nowhere for me to practice well do not,worry that's what we are going to do today
and remember you can always come and play here,thanks ready to try one sure
uh let's see how about this one,uh that looks a little difficult
okay let's see,have you ever played this one uh nope i've never played it and
probably never will it looks a little tough,do you know this one that one yeah

know her very well yet and i just do not want to do anything rude or,disrespectful why would you do anything like that
just be yourself and everything will be great i hope so,now where should i tell them to sit well it is customary to seat the most
important guest at the head of a table right there,got it and remember it is appropriate to offer
your guests a drink when they arrive be sure to offer both alcoholic and,non-alcoholic drinks so they can choose a drink right right and then you know
ease into the conversation before talking about work start with a,bit of small talk just to get things going okay
and after everyone's more comfortable you can talk about other things like,what is going to happen when you start working in your new position so is it
all right to talk about work while we are having dinner or should i wait until,after better wait until
after dinner maybe during dessert,and think before you speak do not say anything inappropriate like
you did last time i've never said anything inappropriate at least not to,anyone at work remember the sales conference last year when you told that
guy how much you hated the speaker and it was his wife yeah that was bad,yeah my gosh they are here
would you relax everything is going to be fine just be,yourself right be myself have fun

you know what this calls for do not you yeah,an apology no
an encore excuse me,we are conducting a survey of opinions about city living do you have a couple
of minutes to answer a few questions sure why not great this will not take long,question number one do you agree
disagree or have no opinion about each of the following statements,there's too much noise pollution in new york i agree
me too okay next rush hour in the city has become,unbearable i totally agree i mean traffic's been an issue here for years
but recently it is gotten a lot worse with all the construction going on,i walk to school so it is not an issue for
me so no opinion i guess okay now just a few more questions what do,you like most about living in new york that's easy the restaurants there are so
many of them mexican japanese indian and thai how,about you i like the fact that there are so many
opportunities in new york if you work hard and push yourself,you definitely can succeed here that's true
but it goes the other way too like if you make a mistake there are 100 people,waiting to take your place yeah but if you are really talented okay okay thank
you next is there anything you do not like,about living in new york where do i start there's not enough
parking there are not enough affordable apartments too many people and they can,be so rude come on i i totally disagree it is not that bad the truth is the
biggest problem is there's not enough time to enjoy everything the city has to,offer if you can get there in this traffic
that's about it there's so many beautiful buildings interesting places,but there are a lot of problems too wait wait wait a minute wait a minute wait a
minute here in new york well well yeah but it,can get expensive you know so all this time you have been pretending that you

lost one of her slippers,the next day cinderella had a visitor

and so they got married and they,and they lived happily ever after
good so change the first part and make,those corrections and your paper will be great
okay for all your help professor morgan i'll email my paper to you later today,you know technology is amazing in high school i used to write my term papers on
a typewriter it must have taken a long time to write a paper on a typewriter,well i was pretty fast but i made some mistakes
actually the typewriters weren't that bad now as for the first computers my,gosh what do you mean the first computers were so unreliable they used
to crash all the time and they were not as affordable or as fast as they are now,mine's pretty fast but not as fast as some of the newer
more expensive ones i know and nowadays almost everyone has a,computer in those days nobody had their own computer we used to use the ones at
the university in the computer lab yeah that's all we had,i'll never forget one spring during final exams everybody was working on
their term papers and the electricity went out so no big deal laptops have,batteries yes but remember in those days we did not have laptops if your computer
crashed you lost everything everything everything we used to lose information,all the time but that time it was terrible
everybody lost their papers that afternoon including me,what did you do i went back to the good old-fashioned way you mean typewriters
nope i use something more affordable,portable reliable
disposable something that always worked,what was that the first word processor
well possessive adjectives we use them to,show that something belongs to somebody or
somebody has something now look at this we have subject,for now like you all know we have i you we they he she it
the possessive adjective of i is my,you is your
we our,they they are
he her,it is we have
i and my i have dark brown hair or i can say my,hair is dark brown for you and your
you have the fashionable blouse or we can say,your blouse is fashionable we and our
we have three expensive cars or you can say our three cars are expensive,they and there they have an intelligent dog or i can
say their dog is intelligent he,and his he has a really nice apartment
or his apartment is really nice she and her,she has an sorry she has adorable children or we
can say her children are adorable and the last one it has a,pretty long tail or we can say its tail is pretty long
the same vowel letters e a together but this is,meat right this is
this one red,red so we have
and this one break,break so we have a
so the same ea but different ways of pronunciation,e e a right
okay the same two consonants together c h,so this is chicken
chicken so we have,this one machine
machine so this is,and this one chemistry
chemistry so we have k okay what about this one,child right child
but when we just add r,e n
at the end of child so how we pronounce this one,is it children no it is children right
so we have children,this is woman
we have woman,but when we just replace
e for a how do we pronounce this one,is it women
no this is,we mean
women women,women okay and this one
this is a ray break,break and this one this one is fast
fast break,fast but when we match them together okay you know this word right how do we
pronounce this word is it,break fast no
it is wreck,first breakfast
why is that well i have to say that that's the way,english is and
remember that there is no fixed pronunciation rules or pattern for,english words so how can we make sure that when you
study an english word you are able to know,that you are pronouncing it
as correctly or nearly correctly as the way the native speakers do without any,help from your teachers or other people well the answer of course is to study

now yeah right here in the corner what are you watching the basketball,game unbelievable
and cheryl does not mind this yes sorry,my team is winning this new invention does not bother you
are you kidding if i'd known how happy they would make,him i would have bought those glasses for bob long ago
technology today is amazing you know,i wish they'd invent something that would make people who talk on cell
phones quieter this guy in the cafe today was so loud i couldn't hear myself,talking what
sorry i was laughing at this guy on tv,if i could invent something it would be a thing for bob's car that
would automatically charge him when he goes over the speed limit,he drives so fast sometimes but he'd slow down if he had to pay no
is your team losing no i heard what you said,you just leave my car alone
hi paul wait till you see what i've got what is it,well i have this problem with my cell phone
whenever I am traveling with a group i can never hear it ring or feel it,vibrate so i got this thing
that lets me know whenever my phone is ringing,how does it do that it buzzes me
buzzes you know so i could feel it does it work,i do not know no one's called me yet
hello hello,no one's there wow
that was a big buzz that almost hurt maybe it is not working,right it is working fine
another phone call that's hello,man if i ever get used to that i'll always
know whenever my phone is ringing stop calling me,paul if i were you i would take that thing
back to the store before you hurt yourself,I am going i'll see you later
i hope he can drive okay he'll be fine,how do you know i'll stop calling him
hello bob dining alone,paul and marie went to get newspapers do you mind if i join you
please sit down may i ask what you are reading,um the history of the world the best seller
I am very impressed reading nonfiction over lunch,i hear that it is a very difficult book uh
no it is it is a pretty easy read i,i cannot put it down actually a real page turner huh
do you think i could borrow it when you are done,sure i usually prefer fiction myself you know
thrillers mysteries there's nothing like curling,up with a good science fiction novel is there
you read science fiction too do not tell anyone,are you learning a lot from your book yeah i think so
so tell me what you are reading about right now um,this part is about
great britain really,do you mind if i take a look cheryl hates when i read comics
then i can understand why you cannot put the book down,and think that i could borrow it then well I am still reading this one but i
have another one i can loan you i meant this one,help yourself
look at this the paper says that a tornado carried a woman for 300 miles,and she lived to tell about it I am not sure if you know this
but that story is not true it is in the paper it must be true,that paper is trash i cannot believe you are reading it
what do you mean it is fiction it is not news nothing in,there is true if you want real news you have to read
this paper that paper is boring this one's much more interesting,woman gives birth to cow man builds house from bread
baby with two heads come on this is offensive,storm kills 100 in texas train accident kills five injures more
man kills wife and son I am sorry but all that death and,destruction is pretty offensive to me i know that these things happened and i
know that those did not you do not know that you just assume that,it is true let's ask bob and mr evans what paper
they read never mind let's just read,that sounds good to me look at this a man with four legs
did you see the politicians expect to,raise taxes again really what does the government decide to spend our money on
now they are planning to build a stronger,military it is wrong to spend so much on the
military they should spend it on education instead,can we please avoid discussing politics why
every time we begin talking about politics people get mad at each other,they should spend more money on fighting corruption
if they were able to stop corrupt officials,maybe they would not need to raise our taxes
that's true but i think we need to spend more money,on the military without a strong military the world will not be very safe
that's one way to look at it but,maybe the world would be safer and better if we try to eliminate
poverty what do you think cheryl,i think that if i say what i really think you'll
get all mad and call me crazy or ridiculous,cheryl do not be so afraid we are only talking
i think that the government should spend more,money on cooking schools
what most people do not know how to cook well,i think the government should help teach them
that's ridiculous are you crazy,use our taxes to pay for cookies of course not
but look at you you are all mad at me,this is why i never discuss politics with friends
but do not let me stop you from getting mad at each other,paul i never knew you were so conservative
I am not conservative sure you are you always seem to want,things to be just like they used to be that's not conservative that's just
smart thanks,that's the definition of conservative really well i did not know you were so
radical what makes you think I am radical,you always want to change everything no i do not
i just want our government to realize that it is the 21st century and they need,new ways of doing things thank you
that sounds radical to me bob,tell him I am not a radical she has not a radical
she has a liberal like me,i would not call you a liberal really i'd say you are more of a moderate you are
always in the middle if i want to be a liberal i'll be a liberal,thank you honey you can be whatever you want you just
cannot be one thing and call it something else,listen to you you are like a little dictator
i studied politics in school i know something about the definition of,political beliefs is that so
so what is cheryl a radical,moderate conservative
who knows she has not saying cheryl what are you would you mind,telling us that much okay
you want to know what i believe i believe,i believe i believe these are the best chips i
have ever tasted everyone we'd like to ask your opinion,about something what is that
we are trying to decide where to go on vacation after the wedding for our,honeymoon we thought you might be able to help us decide on a location
an excellent idea where are you thinking of going,well bob does not really like to travel
so he has agreed to go wherever i want to go,as long as the hotel has nice bathrooms and a tv
that sounds fair what is your first choice,i've always wanted to go to cozumel off the yucatan peninsula
cozumel is spectacular the island itself is pretty flat but the beaches are,beautiful and the ocean is so blue are not there too many sharks to go
swimming there no it is very safe what,but it is somewhat overrated
you just said what else are you thinking of,what about tierra del fuego in the south of argentina in chile
the scenery is extraordinary for the mountain ranges and national,parks are breathtaking but in june
will not it be too dark to do very much no plenty of people go there in june to go,skiing or but of course it is
probably not romantic enough i've heard the jungles and rainforests,in malaysia are a must see they are so lush
of course some people feel that the scorpions make,it too dangerous to hide we could go to that hotel on grant
street along the river stay in town,for our honeymoon well i
heard the rooms have really nice bathrooms and,big televisions
cheryl you once told me that you wanted to go,to tahiti that's right i forgot about that
you would love tahiti one of the most beautiful places,on earth and very very romantic
really you all think tahiti is a good idea,i think you'd love it it is too expensive
how expensive well do you remember how much mr rasheed's,vacation to tahiti cost yes i do
he traveled cheaply that's it,I am out of ideas i guess we'll go someplace boring
we weren't going to tell you until a couple months from now,but paul marie and i were talking and we thought a vacation in the south
pacific would be perfect i just wish we could afford it,so we decided that as our wedding gift to
you we'd like to send you to tahiti all expenses paid,you are kidding we booked your flights and a hotel on

paul could you plan the music yes good,now marie i called 10 restaurants and had them
give us a prize for a party room these two have the best prices,the green room is a nice restaurant great
that's my favorite too now bob about the food i was thinking,steak and potatoes a client asked for fish or chicken
so i had the restaurant put together a menu with each which do you like better,i like chicken more than fish i guess great
chicken it is now paul let me guess you have a list of,music choices these look fine great
i think we are all done you see how easy it is to plan something,when we do it all together glad we could help
another wonderful dinner cheryl thank,you you are welcome i really enjoy cooking actually
when i was young i thought i was going to be a chef,you could be a chef these cookies are fantastic
why did not you become a chef my mother talked me out of it,she thought i would always have to work at night
she was afraid i would never meet a man and get married,she was probably right if you were a chef you would not have met bob
how do you know before he met you bob only ate fast food,it is true your mother must have been very happy
when you and bob got engaged she was,hey you'll never guess what bob was going to
be cheryl,a rock musician a basketball player no
bob was going to be a dancer he was actually in the state ballet when,he was young no kidding you never told me this
i could have been a great dancer what made you change your mind,the diet was too hard i had to stop eating everything chocolate cake fried
chicken potato chips i tried i might have been able to do it,but then they said no more bread and butter
bread and butter can you believe it and that was the end,wow bob i never knew do you enjoy watching ballet at all i
cannot i'd like to,but as soon as the music starts i get very very
hungry what about you mr evans,what did you think you were going to be when you were younger
if i tell you will you try not to laugh of course,i always thought i would have my own television program
to talk about etiquette i did not know you were so interested in,etiquette i have always loved etiquette i think i would have made a great
television etiquette teacher well,i think you could still do it it is perfect for you
really why,well you are very polite for one thing
you always know which fork to use at a restaurant,that's a real talent you taught me a lot about the customs of
other cultures maybe i could still give it a try,today's topic dinner conversation
if your international guests look offended and are leaving the table early,you have probably chosen a topic that's taboo in their home country
find out what is acceptable and what is not coming up on,international etiquette with evans what do you think
wow amazing,unforgettable you have a real
talent all right,thank you i do not know
i did not know that planning a wedding would be so hard,marie could you give us your opinion on a few things
i'd love to first how many people should we invite,bob wants a small wedding 20 guests would be nice
i want a large wedding about 300 people 300,yesterday you said 200. i have a lot of relatives who want to
come then there's the location i always,thought i'd get married in a park or at the beach
that's so romantic i would like to get married indoors,where i will not get wet if it is raining that makes sense
i prefer traditional music in the ceremony,contemporary music i'd like a long ceremony and a short
reception i want a short ceremony and a huge celebration afterwards i want a,white case and i want a chocolate cake i know how we ever gonna agree on this
do not hurt yourself here's an idea that might work,plan a wedding that's big enough to include all of cheryl's family sorry bob
in the park on oak street that has that building where you can go if it rains,you can have traditional music in the ceremony and contemporary music at the
party and you could have two cakes at the,reception one white and one chocolate sounds okay to me
me too hey we did it yay,I am so happy excuse me
marie thank you so much you are amazing,we couldn't have done it without you
hi lunchtime is over are you coming up to,the office I am too tired to go back to the office

evans we cannot come back to work that's a great idea,what are we celebrating you are getting married
how about national wedding day what happens on national wedding day,i do not know why am i the one who has to think about
it why do not we make it national singles,day instead all the married people give gifts to
their single friends no,buying gifts is hard work i want to enjoy myself on our new
holiday what about a red day,everybody wears red clothes and there's dancing in the street that goes on all
night how about national,buy your friend another cup of coffee nice try

thank you madame,sorry nicole what did she say she said we can have a look at the flat she has
going to wait downstairs thanks so what do you think it is a long way,from the station and it is on the fourth floor it is a pity
there is not a lift who needs one the stairs are good exercise,look there's a great view from here it is also very noisy sure but it has
character it is just how i imagine an apartment in paris everything's old,including the heating it will be very cold in the winter

i cannot wait to see it yeah,are you okay are you on your own
no I am with the woman who owns the apartment i'll call you back,okay speak later love you

calling from america you know she has just taking an interest,taking your interest that's nice
i got a message this morning it is from jacques,ali it is jack I am in rome
my return flight's been cancelled there's a small problem,scarlett scalpino is in paris for her concert this evening i was going to look
after her today could you possibly take care of her,thank you and see you later
you have met scarlet scarpino have not you been,the punk princess yeah i met her in london last year
what is she like let's say she has a bit,difficult what are we going to do with her
why do not you show her around paris i have a better idea why do not you show,her around paris what me I am new here you cannot leave me to do this on my own
okay why do not we take her to notre dame i mean it is her first time in paris,is not it i do not think churches are really her thing
how about taking her on a boat trip brilliant and then we can go up the,eiffel tower that's a good idea I am sure she'll love the view and she might fall
off thanks for your help ben,shall we have lunch after that let's go somewhere really nice
do you have any recommendations ben what about la renaissance as shaq's,favorite that sounds perfect uh ben do you want to come too
sorry ally I am really busy but I am sure you'll have an unforgettable meal,so scarlet what would you like nothing
are not you hungry sure but this food's really horrible,this is one of the finest restaurants in paris well i cannot eat this stuff
i never touch meat the seafood looks good,hey fish have feelings too
what about the mushroom risotto mushrooms,no way did not they tell you guys about my
allergies I am allergic to mushrooms strawberries,nuts shall we go someplace else whatever
I am going to the restroom well that was a disastrous morning the,boat trip made her feel sick and she would not go up the eiffel tower
i cannot stand heights to pity we did not just take her shopping,she has so spoiled come on she has just a kid really
so what are we going to do about lunch shall we leave now,no hang on i have an idea let me talk to the waiter miss you
do you think you could possibly do me a favor yes of course so what would you,like well i think this place is great
more wine alley no thanks what was that,what is this it is your lunch scarlett
but i did not order anything hey,pizza margarita cool that was a great concert last night
scarlett thanks as we know scarlet's got a new cd coming,out soon so let's have a look at the best way we can promote it in france
okay well i think scarlett should visit the,major music stores in my opinion that's the best way to meet her fans
I am not so sure what do you think jack actually i do not agree with mark,scarlet is not commercial in that way scarlett
scarlett i agree with jacques,i do not have a commercial image it is not my style
okay but scarlet needs more publicity what about a series of tv and radio,interviews do not you agree yes well that's what everybody does
what we want is something different personally,i think scarlett should tour clubs and summer festivals
she can dj play her favorite music,play the new cd and meet her fans too yes absolutely that's a much better idea
mark okay why not,scarlet i think
that's a great idea thank you jacques,it is great to be on our own again yeah
this is the first time you have been to the louvre uh-huh,what is the matter is this about the meeting because i
agreed with jack and not with you yeah well we knew it would not be easy,working together i mean it is difficult for me as well but if i
do not agree with you i know i know you are the boss and i have to do my job,i really thought that jack's idea was better and
so did scarlet it is not a big deal ally I am fine really,so who exactly was the mona lisa I am not sure
i think she was the wife of a banker is that why she has smiling because her,husband has a good salary i also read somewhere that she was a
self-portrait of leonardo a self-portrait you are kidding,now i do not know much about art but leonardo da vinci was a man right well
it is just a theory why do you think she has smiling,well in my opinion she has the managing director of a music company
what she lives in paris she has in love with her marketing director and she has,a lot of fun telling him what to do that's really unfair hey we are not in
the office now you cannot tell me I am wrong let's get a coffee good idea,do not turn around what is it i've just seen ben from the office where
i said do not look i do not think he has seen us let's get out,of here come on hello did you have a nice weekend
yeah you'll never guess who i saw on saturday,ally and mark
in the louvre together really,you are joking it was definitely them
and they looked really close i think they were holding hands,no i do not believe it it is true I am telling
you and i think they saw me because they,turned and left really quickly are you serious
you know I am not surprised i think they have been seeing each other,ever since mark arrived or maybe even before
that's incredible what makes you say that when i went to look at mark's new,apartment I am sure ali called them on his mobile
and i've seen her looking at him in a certain way hey quiet everyone it is,mark hi

you were just being fair and very british so if it was not me it must have,been you what i've got my own office you are with them

wonderful I am so happy to hear that was your flight okay no pretty bad actually,it was so bumpy it was very scary that's too bad
did you have nice weather after you arrived no the weather was terrible very,rainy i actually never saw the sun that's awful
so what did you do i stayed inside the hotel,was the hotel room nice the room was fine but it was right next to the cafe
and the music was very loud i did not sleep much,i'll bet the food was great no it was too salty for me and the waiters were
very unfriendly did you go shopping at all a little bit until someone stole my,wallet after that i stayed in the hotel and read a book
was the flight home okay actually they cancelled my flight i had to stay for,two more days that's
terrible but mr rashid you said that your vacation was wonderful yes i did,and it was wonderful i met a very nice person a woman actually her name is
basmar she has from lebanon just like me but she lives here I am seeing her,tonight so yes it was a wonderful vacation that's great mr rashid
yes,mr rasheed welcome back come tell me about your vacation
what a terrible vacation mr rashid had,you know on my vacation last year someone stole
my car that was a horrible vacation,i went on a cruise and there was an outbreak of illness i was in my room for
a week that was a really bad vacation i went to,disney world and someone stole my map that's
your worst vacation it took 10 minutes to get another map,all right what was your favorite vacation
i spent two weeks in the caribbean last year diving snorkeling and swimming with,dolphins it was amazing i went to china a few years ago
it was incredible the people there were so friendly and everyone wanted to,practice their english with me i went to the beach
and ate shrimp that's your best vacation,i really like shrimp you need to go on more exciting
vacations i do not like exciting vacations in fact i do not like to travel,very much then
why do you work in a travel agency it is across the street from my apartment,so i do not have to travel far to go to work
so mrs beatty we should talk about your safari trip to botswana,I am so excited my first time in africa you are going to be flying into
johannesburg south africa would you like a window or an aisle a,window i want to see everything in johannesburg you should take a taxi
or a limo to your hotel the next day you could fly or you could,take a train to france's town in botswana
is it an express train yes,i'll take the train i'd like to see the country great
then after you see francis town you can take a small plane or a bus to the,okavanga delta how small is the airplane it is pretty
small i'll take the bus,is it an express bus i think so
when you get to gomari you are going to be taking a boat to your hotel,a boat the hotel is on an island when you get to the island a man with a
donkey can take your luggage to the hotel,a donkey there are no cars on the island
is it an express donkey i think it is probably a local donkey,of course if you do not want the donkey you could take a small plane it goes
straight to the hotel i think i should take the donkey,donkeys never have mechanical problems right right
so many people do it all over south,africa hello mrs baby why hello paul where are you traveling to now mrs
beatty is going on a safari in the okavanga delta in botswana nice,are you flying in are you taking the train bus boat dunky route
I am going to be taking the donkey i did that once myself you did was it very,exciting it was on the way there the plane had mechanical problems
that sounds scary we got in late and i missed the train to francis town,so i decided to take a bus but i got on the local bus by mistake
i do not like local buses then the bus had an accident,so i rented a car but it broke down
dear i got to gomari two days late then i got seasick on the boat to the,island my did you have any problems with the
donkey i got bumped from the dump you mean they overbooked the donkey no i,mean the donkey bumped me off the road to the hotel
but it was a very exciting trip you'll love africa so,any questions mrs beatty just one how much is a ticket to paris

i wonder who paul is thanks for making the key give me a hug,dear it is okay
hi lena hi agatha how was your day at the beauty center,fine fine have you just been to the gym
uh yes how did you guess with paul actually yes but you do not know,paul no i do not but elena told me about him
we'd love to meet him why do not you invite him to supper one evening,i'll cook him a special meal of course i will one of these days
so did you like the changing we did while you were away yes,yes great now victor i suggested that you and elena
should go to the beauty center together one day,me to the beauty center well it is for men
too and there's a fitness center well i suppose you are right would you like to,do that elena yes i would i'd love to
and i might invite paul to come too no no just the two of,you that's the whole point can you peel the potatoes did you buy
the steak I am starving steak and potatoes for me,victor forget the potatoes we have to talk
you really should spend more time socializing,you must get out more go to the movies or something
but i have to prepare for my exams well you can study during the week,not at the weekends you must dedicate more free time to seeing your friends
and making new friends like my new friend,paul no no i did not mean him you should take elena out with you
she could practice her english well i have to study a lot it is my final year,i cannot remember the last time you went out with a girl
you are not ugly victor you do attract women's attention,i cannot understand it and you do not have to tell me if you do not want to
thanks for that where's the butter for frying,you do not need all that butter you should use olive oil instead it is better
for you i read an article in the newspaper about,depression and the foods we eat what we eat affects our personality
and how we react to others i know if i do not eat I am not a nice person,okay i cannot live on meat alone there are the food groups breads cereals
rice and pasta poultry and fish and you can exclude eggs,vegetables fruits beans milk yeah yeah you use too much butter
you do not have to give up your butter and chocolate biscuits,I am just saying you should use less it will help you to stay healthy and fit
and that's a good thing is not it sure but you have to eat,more vegetables they are an important source of vitamins
i always have tomatoes and olives on my pizza,dear i cannot help you you should go to a doctor and have a
checkup that's enough i cannot take it anymore you have to stop,trying to control my life you should respect my life and how i
live it I am sorry i just think that you should,do things you should you should not you cannot
you must you mustn't not everyone is like you i,thank goodness i do not have to explain my lifestyle to you
dear what have i done did i offend him,uh why do you have those bags where are you going i guess then i've
already decided I am moving out what,now you are leaving now where are you going
what what has happened why are you moving out,i do not want to disturb anyone i think victor and i need to lead separate lives
victor needs his freedom I am so upset,not everyone has the same character elena you are timid and shy
victor's more reserved not everyone is sociable and outgoing like,me I am too demanding
now you are being dramatic i do not fit in here,I am leaving I am going to betty's upset does it mean sad yes
a combination of sad and angry perhaps you did not like the new furniture victor,but while you were away she said she liked the bookcase anyway you are not
moving out do not be ridiculous where will you leave I am going to stay,with betty for a few weeks then i'll decide
are you two fighting no well we had an argument last night you just,have to respect other people's decisions more that's all you do not have to move
out i think victor is saying you just have,to give him more space but you do not have to move a house to do
that it will not be the same without you here,it is just sometimes you are stubborn and selfish
but you are also very caring loyal generous funny,funny like fun humorous I am demanding and bossy too right
listen you two i think we all have to calm down,i do not understand all the words you are using but insulting each other is not
going to help victor you have a lot to do and i am,sure you have been a little anxious recently
sorry agatha when I am studying for exams i become very nervous,this is an important time for me see agatha he has apologizing and I am sure

diary since you were 16 and if you want to lose weight you,should eat less dairy should number one
you should to the bed early shoot is a motorboat so after that we,should use go or going of course that is
go the base form of the verb that means an infinitive without two so,you should go to bed early go to bed early that means to go to
sleep early okay you should go to bed early,i think go to bed going to bed early is good for your health so you should go to
bed early number two i think,think we should take taking or take him to the hospital

and then take i think we should take him to the hospital,her dad should stop scolding her if you scold if you scold
a person that means you speak angrily to that person,um because that person has done something wrong
should not now should not is actually should not but the native,speakers do not usually use should not
they use should not instead should not and,after should not is the infinitive without to
that means the base form of the verb you can say,should and then the verb or should not should not should then or should not and
then the verb based on the verb we should not go right now it is,raining you should not be late for the interview
your daughter should not eat too much fast food,now for shoot when we can use shoot to ask a question
number one should i if you begin the question which should i,that means you are asking somebody like uh is that a good idea for me to do so
should i quit or quit my job here,so now we use quit or quits of course should i
quit my job that means do you think that is a good idea to quit my job,should i quit my job where should we go to buy the coffee table what should i do
