now look at these examples here my boyfriends very tall okay very very,tall my boyfriends very tall i think
I am quite short quite short that means that I am not,really short I am just quite short okay

just like quiet and really just like very really or very,very tall really tall quite short pretty short okay
his brother is pretty short she has about 170,centimeters tall okay you can use centimeters here
she has about 170 centimeters tall,i guess if you do not know you can make a guess i guess he has about five feet
nine inches usually in western countries people like to use feet an inch right i,guess he has about five feet nine inches
again my brother sorry my boyfriends very,tall i think I am quite short
he has not very tall sorry he has not really tall about average,his brother is pretty short
she has about 107 centimeters tall,i guess he has about five feet nine inches now lets go to the example i have four
questions here how,are you 180 centimeters tall like you look at a
person and then you guess i maybe like he is 180 centimeters and then you can,ask him are you 180 centimeters tall am i right okay
how tall are you like i want to know like your,measurement how tall are you now i want to know your height
are you shorter than your sister okay like,your your sister is taller than you right or you are shorter than your
sister right are you shorter than your sister,who is the tallest in your family okay a lot of people but who is the tallest
who is the tallest in your family now lets see the answers for number one are,you 180 centimeters torr
yes i am yes right or no I am not and then you can,say your heart I am 175 centimeters tall yes i am no I am not
I am 175 centimeters tall again are you,180 centimeters tall yes i am or no I am not I am
175 centimeters tall number two how tall are you,I am about six feet if you are not sure you cannot say I am about six feet okay
are you shorter than your sister if that is true you say yes i am or,or no we are about the same height that means
like for example like I am six feet and she has six feet two so we are about the,same height or we are at the same height okay um
now we are about at the same height so again,are you shorter than your sister yes i am or no we are about the same
height who is the tallest,in your family i think that is the tallest in my family
maybe your dad your sister your brother anyone,okay i think that is the tallest in my family or if
you are sure about that you will say definitely that is the toilets in my,family okay but if you are not sure you can say i think i guess

be very disappointed,okay well tell you
wildlife magazine offered greg a job in brazil,what i sent them pictures from our trip i
just hoped theyd like them and they did thats great greg,but do you two really want to live in brazil
it would be a big change ive never thought of leaving the us,but it would be an adventure and you know i like a good adventure

whats wrong aaron do not worry about it nick,it is not important are you sure i want to go to college
but i still have so many questions to answer,like what like how will i pay for college
yes that will be hard and there are other questions too,what are you going to do i do not know
sometimes i just want to give up thats how i felt when the band broke up,but then becca told us not to give up and now
we have a great band right,well then i guess i should not give up
right scott hey rita is something wrong,yes we just got fired

hi erin hi moms meeting me here for coffee she,says she has a surprise for me what do you think it is
i do not know but mom says ill like it hi mom,so whats the surprise you cannot wait can you
no okay,we are going to take a trip to europe europe ive always wanted to travel to
europe i know when are we going where are we going how,long can we stay well go during your christmas vacation
well stay about a week but where will we go,dad says you and i can decide wow
lets go to paris rome london,wait a minute well only have a week for sightseeing
thats right you cannot see all the famous places in one week so we should,choose one place yes
okay what do i want to see in europe,paris is famous for great art museums london also has some great museums
and we can speak english there so how are we going to decide,why do not you look on the computer good idea
lets see which cities have things we really want to see,there are so many places to go in europe lets just choose two cities and decide
between them that would be easier,we can each choose one where do you want to go
paris i think why,i want to go to paris to see the louvre what about you amber i want to go to
london there are lots of attractions there,though youll decide between paris and london
right there are some cool castles in london,i know those would be fun to see
so lets go to london but i would love to see the eiffel tower in paris too,which city is easier to get around both cities have subways
that would be the best way to travel around this is not going to be an easy,decision paris and london both have interesting
attractions and delicious food,and cool stores and they are both expensive you cannot choose the cheaper
place how are we going to decide,well lets go home and talk to dad
right well just have to tell him tell him what,tell him we need a longer vacation hi honey

i love my music store it must be fun to do something you love,it is do not you like working at the stop and
shop it is not bad,but it is not easy i always have to compare prices with
other stores i know what you mean,every month I am figuring out what our prices should be
right you are always asking yourself,are prices too high what would happen if prices were lower
right it is not fun,and it is hard to compete with large discount
stores it is,i wish i could just have a nice little store with no problems
i do not like worrying about being profitable every month,thats business but it is also exciting right
it has been but ive thought about doing something,else really
what would you like to do managing the stop and shop is not an,adventure but
managing profit and loss margins every month,can be exciting you really think so
i have to admit liz i like business,really i like it almost as much as i like music
wow thats great so what are you going to do,nothing the stop and shop might not be exciting
but it is a good business besides what else would i do,i do not know what do you like
i like adventure i loved brazil,well business is an adventure
maybe one month is a down month the adventure is trying to do better the,next month right right

city what about yourself,do you live in sydney no i live in melbourne I am just here for
the conference I am going to melbourne later,whats the weather like there not too good in winter but at the moment
it should be okay so,hows your hotel it is good very convenient
just near the harbour have you seen the opera house yet yes we,flew right over it excuse me theres someone i must talk to
it is been very nice to meet you I am walter by the way you too I am sue,perhaps well meet later i hope so
has everybody got a copy of the agenda would you mind taking minutes john,not at all good well then lets get started
first of all thank you everyone for attending at,short notice as you know the objective of this
meeting of the capital works committee is to discuss a proposal for some urgent,building work at our south side plant as we have got to reach a decision which
may involve spending well run it as a formal meeting,now you have read the proposal so without further ado id like to open
it up for discussion or perhaps if we can start with you tan,whats your view well I am not convinced that the work is
as urgent as this report suggests so to sum up i think we are all aware,that some urgent work does need to be done and we will need to work on a
longer term plan for a major refit well,if theres no more discussion well put it to a vote
we are recommending that tenders be called for the urgent work needed,all those in favor all those against
then thats agreed any other business,then well close the meeting thank you everyone the next meeting will
be in two weeks at the same time well I am not convinced that the work is,as urgent as this report suggests so perhaps come on the building is
practically falling down sorry lin i do not think tan had finished well get,to you in a minute sorry as i was saying
perhaps we should get a second opinion before we spend any money,thank you tan whats your opinion walter
well as far as I am concerned it is a question of safety so i think we should,go ahead are you suggesting that someone could
get hurt in my opinion yes if you ask me there is a serious risk of,an accident and it is not a recent problem
are you implying we should have done something earlier,much earlier it is a real concern here in that case i agree
we should do something now i think so too,thank you walter well if theres no excuse me madam
chairperson yes barbara what about the problem with parking there were no,places again this morning maybe if you got to work on time
all comments through the chair if you do not mind walter,parking is not on the agenda for this meeting
perhaps you could suggest it for our next meeting barbara,well if theres no more discussion well put it to a vote here here
okay now we are looking at the options for,handling our online orders they are going through the roof and frankly the lead
time for delivery is blowing out we need to improve our performance in,this area any suggestions
well as i said we have three options the obvious one is to employ more people,to do the job another alternative is to automate the
system more cut down on the physical handling,and the third option we could outsource
what are the pros and cons well looking at increasing staff versus,automation we have to consider the cost automating has a higher capital cost
than putting on more staff on the other hand employing more people,is more expensive over a long term if we keep growing itll cost more in
the long run how likely is it that well see,continued growth id say it is a certainty
id say a high probability nothing certain in business,so what about the third option outsourcing
it does take the problem off our hands but we lose contact with our customers,what about the bottom line outsourcing is the cheapest option and
the easiest in the short term but if we want to keep the operation in,house the best option is automating our system
the only downside is we are taking a risk that our business will keep growing,which we hope it will we certainly do today we are looking at our new widget
plant being built at south side ive asked barbara to report on progress and,bring us up to date and up to speed barbara thanks denise
ill just outline the process we have been through identify some problems and give,you an estimate on completion time and the outcome financially is it good news
or bad news bear with me,now if you recall after a feasibility study we put the
project out to 10 to 18 months ago and selected easy build as our project,manager work commenced about 15 months ago and
it is been progressing to schedule until recently,whats the problem unfortunately there are
three firstly theres been a delay in materials,specifically steel because of industrial issues at the suppliers
secondly we have lost days due to the weather,and finally theres been a resulting cost blowout
so what are we going to do well they have managed to get another,supplier now i suggested moving the completion date
back that way theres no penalty and they agreed to redeploy their workers,until building can start again smart thinking
we have been waiting for the rain to stop but we cannot control the weather,and the cost at this stage just a small overage but
ill be watching it very closely over the next few months,with no more delays we are expecting to complete the project
just one month behind schedule good work barbara,now id like to refer to the first graph as you can see this is a bar graph
measuring net sales over the first 10 months of the year,youll notice that sales rose steadily in the first few months
then there was a marked increase in april,they peaked in may at around 32 million and leveled off
then there was a dramatic drop in the following month,followed by a significant increase in august and this trend has continued up
until the present what was the reason for the sudden drop,in july this was mainly due to a dropoff in air
conditioner sales so it is a seasonal effect,could it be a consequence of the negative effect of the interest rate
rise possibly,now if i could draw your attention to this next diagram
this is a line graph of sales the blue line represents air conditioner,sales the red line shows heaters
as youll note air conditioner sales dropped steadily from january to july,bottoming out then while heater sales experienced a sharp
increase from march to june then dropped markedly from june to july,then declined through to september with a pronounced drop in october
does this explain the fluctuation in total sales largely if we look at this,pie diagram you can see that air conditioners and
heaters together represent more than half of our total sales,but they vary seasonally while other appliances are fairly steady through the
year well we cannot sell air conditioners when,it is cold whats the solution
export to europe and america easier said than done,today I am going to look at the results of our customer survey
first ill go through the survey questions,then summarise the results and finally ill outline the conclusions
after that therell be time for questions and discussion so,lets start with the survey questions turning to the results
as you can see from the diagram most people decided what to buy when,they saw the product at the showroom about onethird made their decision
based on what the salesperson said the others knew what they wanted to buy,already most of those made their decision on the
recommendation of a friend only a few said they relied on,advertising lets move on to the conclusions
the first one is that it is very important that,salespeople on the floor know about our products
another is that after sales service is critical,people who experience good after sales service are more likely to recommend a
brand and finally,advertising it is expensive so we need to make sure
we are getting results so id like to end with a summary of,what ive looked at today and some recommendations
the figures show that sales are strongly seasonal and that customers depend on,good information on the showroom floor so id like to recommend we concentrate
on discounting in the off seasons and spend more time on briefing our sales,representatives thats all i have for now
are there any questions you mentioned that the sales figures,may also reflect economic trends can you expand on that
well we are always going to depend on the economy,as i understand it we can look forward to an improvement this year
does that answer your question are you saying we are in for a period of,growth well I am afraid thats a bit outside my
area of expertise but thats what the papers are suggesting,if you believe it you suggested that we might be spending
too much on advertising can you clarify that,it is hard to quantify without better data
sorry could you repeat that,we do not have the figures to really know how effective our advertising is
in my experience you cannot do without advertising,time for one last question i have one yes john
is it time for coffee okay well wrap up now,thank you for your input everyone thank you
wilson wilson can i help you yes this is lynn chan from acme appliances id like,to speak to mr wilson if he has available please would that be mr wilson senior or
mr wilson jr mr wilson senior ill just see if he has available hold the,line please
it is a lynn chan from acme I am sorry mr wilsons in a meeting at,the moment may i take a message yes could you ask him to phone me please
my number is two three double one five six five four I am sorry,i did not catch your name lin chan acme appliances let me check
the number two three double one five six five four thats right,ill pass that message on thank you thanks bye
acme appliances lynn chan speaking this is tom wilson returning your call,ah yes mr wilson thanks for calling back i wanted to set up a meeting with you to
discuss your requirements for next year yes certainly how about uh,thursday at 2 30 that would be fine
okay i look forward to seeing you then thursday 2 30 see you then goodbye,goodbye hello lin chan sales manager for
national sugar and my associate john martin very pleased to meet you I am,victor tang and this is my legal advisor sue panet i hope you had a pleasant
flight over yes we did thanks are you staying for a few days unfortunately we,need to get back to manila tomorrow well wed better get down to business
mr tang to start off with i just want to say we believe we can offer you a very,good deal and come up with a winwin result well from our point of view we
see it as an exploratory tool testing the water you might say we do not intend,to reach any agreements at this meeting in any case we would need to run it past
our board first you have not heard our terms yet you may find them hard to,resist of course we understand you need time to
consider any offer my first priority is to keep the negotiations open,whats your proposal ms chen we are prepared to offer a very
attractive price for a minimum sale in exchange for a twoyear contract john,will clarify the terms so thats our offer we believe it is a
fair one with advantages for both sides yes well we are prepared to consider your,offer miss chant if you can accept some conditions
and subject to consideration by the board,what are the conditions well firstly the price you are proposing
would that be variable depending on currency fluctuations,the issue is that we are in an unstable environment at the moment
the exchange rate could affect us negatively,us too true
but the problem is that we are tied to the us dollar we could consider hedging,against currency in both directions that would be acceptable
another problem we may have is that of supply,our customers often need supply at short notice if we do get large orders we need
to guarantee delivery so we need the stockpile,the difficulty there is the capital outlay
how would you feel about a partial offset against our sales you mean alone,i suppose so would you be agreeable to a deferred
payment we can provide security of course,i think that would be acceptable unfortunately i would need to get board
approval for it of course,then i think we might have a deal in principle
time to celebrate our keynote speaker is a man who I am,sure is very well known to all of you he has professor of fruitology at dubbo
university and has written many books on the subject of tropical fruit,so without further ado id like to introduce our keynote speaker dr sam
erics thank you denise,the honourable judith bryant minister for trade professor eric vogel professor
of economics at wagga university distinguished guests ladies and,gentlemen todays topic why bananas are bent
is a very significant one in terms both of international trade and culture,in thinking about the topic i felt it would be appropriate to address briefly
the history of bananas and banana farming the many qualities of bananas,both positive and negative and of course examine the uses of the
banana but first,let me tell you a story about a banana ladies and gentlemen i hope ive been
able to clear up a few misconceptions and leave you with some new ideas about,how we might view bananas in the future we have seen in looking at their history
that bananas have a significant role in many cultures,ive also noted their positive nutritional qualities
and in addressing the main question why bananas are bent we have learned that the,reasons are many and complex madam chair thank you for the
opportunity to address the conference today and thank you ladies and gentlemen,for your kind attention well it has been a great pleasure to
meet you sam and lynn yes we have enjoyed meeting you too victor yes it is been,great what a pity you have to go home well all good things must come to an end
but I am sure well meet again yes i hope so,and good luck with your business I am sure it will go well

whats the name of the hotel please have a seat,warm and happy what can i do for you hi
this is miranda cunningham i would like to talk to the customer,service yes how can i help this is miranda cunningham are you all
right no I am not all right we are freezing,the heating system is not working ill send someone in the afternoon or
tomorrow morning make it this afternoon as i said we are,freezing this is a legal firm and we have a lot
of taxing work to do and it is anything but easy at this,temperature yeah i called yesterday to explain the
situation and i say you do not have to see you have to,come what is your name please i
am matthew peacock mr peacock if things are not put right,straight away i will make a complaint to your superiors
good morning let me give it another try,hi this is rose hi this is miranda cunningham
listen we have had no heating since monday,i called yesterday and today but I am terribly sorry to hear that mrs
cunningham tell me more about what happened so that,i can solve your problem well theres very little to say
the heating system is not working and we tried to fix it but to no avail,i understand let me apologize for the inconvenience
ill send someone to settle the matter right away,you cannot imagine how happy i am to hear that
well we have a good working relationship but i am just the secretary,and miranda constantly reminds me that she has the boss
I am always here early because i absolutely have to clock in by nine,oclock so i usually get to work around 8 45
just in case but miranda arrives late all the time and nobody says anything of,course no i do not work fixed hours and
sometimes i stay in the office after work because we have to meet,deadlines so it can be very stressful it is okay but most of the time i do
routine tasks i file documents answer the phone reply to,emails so I am usually stuck behind a desk
it can be morning linda good morning i never,managed to get here on time traffic is so bad this time of the
morning I am surprised you are always so punctual,you get to work early what time do you leave your house in the
morning usually around 20 past eight i take the tube it is quite quick,but once or twice a week i drive to work so i leave the house around eight
oclock because there can be a lot do we have todays newspaper yes read me,my horoscope lets see what the week is like
scorpio work control your sharp tongue today,try not to be too critical and severe is there anything about love
love you usually say things that upset or offend people,what do you think I am tactless you want me to continue no no thank you
linda just a cup of coffee thanks,sorry for bursting in like this but theres a very attractive man in
reception and he says he has here to fix the coffee machine,well end it is not broken it works perfectly well and we still have plenty
of paper cups stirrers white and brown sugar coffee,and even two types of tea well so then tell them that we do not
need anything and the machine works just fine,but he has here now and he has very attractive and i thought perhaps we
could have him check the machine just in case i see,well perhaps we could spice up the day a bit let him in
certainly thanks this is mrs cunningham the boss good,afternoon hi troy yeah I am here to repair the
coffee machine sold in the cells and what is it we also,have one of your vending machines with chocolates and biscuits
you see linda and i have a sweet tooth but we also have certain dietary,requirements icing some of my clients are allergic to wheat
and some are vegans liz is a vegetarian are not you linda,yes yes i am so is it possible to have some wheat free snacks
and some that are suitable for vegans as well well I am not sure I am just a,technician i repair the machines well perhaps we
can have them send us a brochure with the products sure and the coffee,machine no problem it works just fine but
perhaps there is a small problem with the hot chocolate,it tends to be a bit watery is there any way to make it creamier
lets have a look linda why do not you show troy where the machine is,of course mrs cunningham
well I am sorry to say that there are quite a few mistakes in this report of,yours mistakes are you sure yes
but linda can type it again right sure she can but,I am a bit worried about her you know why linda is a high flyer but these days
she has working too much and she has making some embarrassing mistakes,such as well such as sending an email to mr scorn instead of mrs scoring
you know that couple going through the troublesome divorce can you imagine that,i see linda is a nice girl but she is probably overworked underpaid
and frustrated are you seeing them treating her badly,no i just think that maybe she has too much to do
and she needs less work and more motivation,what do you suggest find another secretary
are you joking she handles my phone calls,she writes emails she deals with the clients and she speaks both german and
spanish fluently i cannot imagine working without her,right i know it is hard without a good secretary so
try and do something to make her feel more motivated,motivation and job satisfaction are at the basis of everything

to think okay so that is thought,thought i have not thought about that i have not thought
about that that means i never think about that i,have not thought about that number three
this is the i know this one is very difficult to pronounce,thread just like three through through
through okay through so through usually through,it is a preposition it usually goes with other verbs to form uh
phrasal verbs to form different meaning for example here,hope that we all get through the exams get through the exams that
mean to pass the exams sarah for british english,we pronounce thera for american english we say verbo thorough okay
thorough or thorough but i usually say thera thera if a person,is a thera that means that person does think very
carefully and with great attention to detail,very very careful okay sarah she she has uh you can say
she has a very thorough woman she has a very thorough woman,rough okay rough that means we usually talk about service for
example the table service the road service the,floor something like that or maybe your skin for example like
uh if you talk about rough rough that mean,not even not regular or not smooth so rough
here for example my skin remember skin skin okay my skin,is quite that means pretty quite rough and hard rough
not smooth and hard that means not soft okay my skin,is quite rough and hard for number six uh i think a lot of people might know
this one but it is not but it is not you know like,or something like this this is ah okay cough cough for british english
and for american english corf corf cafe or corf the same um,that is a verb or noun if it is a noun for example when you are
sick or when you have a code you are like this,so that is corf okay cough or cough our mom

friday is that possible,good good it is very important well be in touch
thank you goodbye mrs lee you have got an exceptional cv,well thank you mr stevens i do not quite understand
why you left spectre according to this you were in a position of considerable,responsibility thats true i was very satisfied with my
job at the beginning i had a very,prestigious position and many highprofile projects were sent
my way however once spector was taken over by a,japanese multinational things just took a turn to the worse my
boss was let go many of my colleagues was transferred,and i was relieved of my duties and of
course well maybe i should not tell you,please do no reason to be afraid well the truth is i just did not get
along with my new boss i appreciate your frankness sincerity,is one of the main qualities that i look for in my employees
but tell me mrs lee how are your bookkeeping,invoicing and administrative skills excellent i would say but i wanted to
speak to you about and are you familiar with the publishing,market uh yes to a certain degree
but as i was saying ever since i was a child ive always been fascinated by,you can tell me about your dreams at another time mrs lee
currently we are busy with our yearend balance sheet,and i need a welltrained assistant to prepare an assessment of our
administrative expenses and to study our assets and liabilities,you considering your experiences appear to
be a perfect fit well thank you mr stevens but once,this emergency has blown over i was wondering if perhaps you could take me
into consideration as a as a yes as,an author I am quite talented my literature professor at university
used to encourage me this is not a school mrs lee,i got in touch with you to speak to you about
our marketing office thats what id like to hire you for,please do not be offended but keep your dreams to yourself for the
moment as far as books are concerned we can get,started on the bookkeeping immediately certainly but later well see
well see excuse me my names victoria lee todays,my first day at work and id like to know
great great way to start where is everybody mr,stevens told me i was going to meet my new colleagues
and they were going to explain everything i wonder if ive come to the,wrong department ah you must be the new arrival pleasure
to meet you I am rachel the pleasures all mine my names victoria lee,mr stevens asked me to show you the office and explain everything
so over there is the facts in the photocopier,this is your desk and computer um what else
yes youll find a coffee machine down the hall but please,remember a few breaks and please keep them short
this gentleman is gary reynolds head of marketing,how do you do I am victoria mr stevens tells me that we are going to be working
closely together i must say it is quite a pleasure to spend so much time with such,a lovely young lady happily married woman married with a son
as a matter of fact well done victoria let him know whos,who garys the kind of guy who cannot control
himself with attractive women thank you for the,compliment rachel lets get down to work
heres an analysis of last years investments,as you can see we have consistently improved our bottom line in all sectors
even if as far as I am concerned we need to move more aggressively into the,market what exactly do you mean well improve
our ecommerce play for example um lets imagine for a moment that,pilgrim were to develop an advanced online catalog that would allow users to
purchase directly online do not you think that this way we could dramatically cut,our distribution costs certainly but what does mr stevens think
well he has a bit old school in his way of thinking,according to his world view we should focus on sales through more traditional
channels i on the other hand would be thrilled if,you saw things more along my lines why do not we develop a realistic
marketing strategy that includes possible ecommerce earnings,uh perhaps we could convince them together
I am afraid i cannot at the moment gary ive got to focus on the bookkeeping to,begin with listen uh why do not we have a little
dinner together tonight and then continue working at my house,I am married remember gary
statistics accounts reports not much has changed from spectre,and i was hoping for a more creative position
hello you must be the new hire I am anne baxter,I am victoria lee i recognize your name have we met before
i do not think so or perhaps we met at the red lion pub,i often go there with my friends no it does not sound familiar
actually i have a son so i do not get out much but still ive heard your name,before just a moment now i remember we met on
the telephone when i was still working at spectre,we both had that problem with our courier fast
yes yes i remember now you were having problems with a shipment,to to china gosh what a coincidence
well who would have ever thought we would end up working together so,how are things going well it is still too early to say todays my first day at
work well i presume you have already met gary yes,earlier we are working on a project together and i
bet he has already invited you out to dinner yes as a matter of fact,and he has probably told you that he loves working with
charming young girls such as yourself yes and how do you know,he always uses the same line he did the same with me
how original well I am pleased that you have joined us here and well,i hope well become great friends yes well I am
sure we will you are very nice and who knows maybe that telephone call was,destiny
whos in charge of delivery to the blue moon bookshop,uh annandai why they have just telephoned complaining that they have not received
anything yet well thats impossible i sent the delivery five days ago thats,just it i do not understand what could have
happened the merchandise should have arrived by now,and call the shipping agents to find out whats up
hello am i speaking to fast shipping this is anne baxter from pilgrim,publishing id like to follow up on the merchandise we sent five days
ago sorry thats impossible,there must be some mistake you cannot have delivered it
our client has just telephone saying that they have not received anything yet,okay okay ill take a look at the paperwork and get back to you
byebye fast claims that the goods were signed for by the,consignee rachel go get the bill of lading
we need to look into what caused this mistake,gary are you sure you provided the exact address
certainly i still remember it it is 35 lafayette avenue orange,thats it all right what about the duty do you remember paying it duty excuse me
mr stevens but we are eu members and not required to pay duty merchandise is free,to move between the member states and duty is no longer required nor is
documentation eu what does europe have to do with it,excuse me but orange is in france is not it good god gary
blue moon is in orange but not in france orange is a city in,massachusetts usa call the bookshop
immediately what an idiot thats why i paid less,on freight charges and was budgeted hello pilgrim publishing this is anne
baxter how may i help you hello this is victoria lee I am calling,in regards to the shipment i was wondering if you had any news yet
yes actually i was just about to call you,unfortunately theres been a misunderstanding
uh but do not worry we are taking care of things on our end,and you should receive the goods very soon could you tell me exactly whats
happened my boss is extremely upset the shipping,documents were in order according to the bill of lading the
supply should have already arrived can you explain why the merchandise is,blocked in the custom warehouse customs
no you see I am afraid theres been a slight problem,in addressing the goods and they have been sent to a destination in france instead
of massachusetts france massachusetts what are you,talking about the merchandise was destined for china
china excuse me um are you the owner of the,blue moon in orange massachusetts no I am not
i work for spectre we are a multinational sporting goods manufacturer,I am speaking with fast shipping well actually no this is
pilgrim publishing I am afraid you have got the wrong number,but we do have something in common we both use the same career
life is funny i dial the wrong number and who do i call a publishing house,maybe it is fate nice young woman as well what was her name anne baxter thats
right we use the same couriers and are both,having problems with deliveries what a strange coincidence mrs lee
have you spoken with fast shippers yet not yet the numbers always busy we have,to figure out whats happened this delivery delay is costing us a lot
of money the courier assured us that the,merchandise did not have to pass through customs that it would have left their
warehouse with the customs bill already compiled without any additional,customs requirements thats right considering the shipping
costs they are so high because they include all,international delivery costs such as transit
loading and unloading assembly and warehouse storage costs,just a moment ive got it did you remember to attach the
certificate of origin mrs lee the certificate of origin i do not really,know what that is it is never been required for our
shipments the certificate of origin is that document which states the,merchandises country of origin for customs purposes
it is absolutely necessary for companies doing business in countries which do not,belong to the eu provided upon customs officials request
and china is one of those countries I am sorry mrs,collins i did not know i swear it up until now
ive never taken care of shipments this is going to be one very,expensive mistake by the way ill be taking our losses
caused by this delay out of your salary,hi victoria why we are until the meeting this morning
which meeting the meeting the mrs collins called,with all the department heads to come to grips with the situation
and i quote to discuss the means with which we can improve,both production and company efficiencies no one told me anything
i bet she did that on purpose my darling boss,she wanted to get back at me for a mistake i made on a shipment
she always keeps me out of the loop on all the important developments and makes,me do the work of a secretary i hate her come on victoria chin up
things will get better I am not sure about that paul,anyway tell me what did you discuss at the meeting
well you can imagine the tone the mrs collins used she prefers cold,and distant she urged us all to work even harder
to overcome this difficult moment for the company,according to her we should be working 24 7
365 listen to this she told the warehouse manager to,calculate the efficiency of workers more precisely
as they go about their tasks and if necessary,to lengthen their hours then she invited mr rover
the personal director to evaluate the necessity of any new hiring,she told him that from now on each and every shortterm or longterm plan
must first be evaluated and approved by her,i always said she was a dictator yeah and she claims that we should be
delighted at her flexibility and the many corporate heads she knows,would jar result with a huge personnel cuts
to improve the situation what an understanding woman,you bet then she added the companies need
to meet deadlines and to work within strict budget,in order to keep clients satisfied and remain competitive in the market
finally referring to you she reminded us all the delays and,errors in projects are absolutely unacceptable
what are you doing victoria are you taking notes,no I am writing my letter of resignation paul do not tell me this is true
are you really gonna leave yes paul i just cannot stay here since mrs collins,has arrived the work climate has become unbearable
she never misses an opportunity to humiliate me and to assign me the most,demeaning tasks and what are you going to do now well
ive got in touch with a number of companies,this afternoon for example i have an interview
with a publishing house publishing house you are not going to become an author are,you precisely you know it is always been a dream of
mine i do not think the interview is going to focus on my,literary talents but paul you look awful whats the matter
I am a bit concerned about things we are having a meeting with the major,shareholders of spectre to take a look at the balance sheets and
is that a problem well as you know the ear and balance,sheets provide an overview of the economical
fiscal and fiduciary effectiveness of our management and i certainly hope,that scrutinizing the books will not uncover inconvenient discrepancies
that could lead to a change over company leadership,what exactly are you referring to as you know things have not been rosy
lately even if there has been a slight,improvement in share prices during the last quarter however at the
same time the outstanding debts to our suppliers,have also increased in other words our revenues do not
cover our expenses the situation is serious then,thats right I am afraid well need to resort to additional
outside financing ive been calculating the various,balance sheets entries to understand whats causing our debts
and try to develop a plan of attack to get our weak points under control,the results are anything but encouraging as you well know
the solidity and integrity of our financial core,assets are indispensable to keeping our production capabilities intact
and revenues flowing i certainly would not want to be in your,shoes at the meeting no kidding I am predicting lightning and
thunder i wish i did not have to participate,perhaps i could come down with a sudden case of
flu or something how about kidney,inflammation accompanied by high fever caused by a highly contagious
virus mysteriously present in the company,your but now that you will not be here ill have to double the work by the way
they do not happen to need someone else at the publishing house you were,speaking about so you are a secret author as well no

so ann how did your meeting with mr stevens and,the montex representative go quite quite well actually it was very
interesting did they come to any agreement for the,moment montrax is going to print 3 000 copies
of our next series of cookbooks mr stevens wants to give them a,a trial run and see how they work if they meet their deadlines and price
competitively hell sign on for for larger deals in the future,we are hoping to optimize our work and drive down costs a little and
the publishing market is in a deep crisis,readership is dropping rapidly which is driving down sales at the same time
production costs are increasing because of foreign rights acquisition,as well as distribution costs as a matter of fact i
i have not bought many books recently tell me rachel does this crisis also,affect us here at pilgrim certainly
the negative trends of the market are felt throughout the sector,beginning with those who work in it in any case I am optimistic and I am sure
this is just a passing crisis and that the,publishing sector will soon recover thats probably what what gary wanted to
talk to me about this morning i saw him and he said that he had,something very important to tell me aha
what why are you making that face no it is it is nothing anne,it is just that it is just that i do not trust gary
he has a latin lover and full of himself he chases all of the pretty girls around,here and you are just his latest victim
look rachel I am perfectly capable of looking after myself,i only have a working relationship with gary and thats how it is going to stay
sorry anne i i certainly did not mean to offend you,I am quite aware that you are an intelligent young woman
who can keep men like gary at a distance in any case i just wanted to warn you,I am sure youll agree with me once you get to know him

what come on ann I am joking i think work is making you just a,little bit too nervous bye yes uh to be honest
i am a bit worried profits are down eight percent,over the last few months and just yesterday
i read an article in uh in in media world,that confirmed my suspicions forecasts for the publishing market
are are quite pessimistic and the general feeling,is that things are going to continue to go downhill based on current trends the
next five years could see a further drop of 20 percent,if we leave out best sellers and fiction then the entire publishing market has
taken a direct hit or better is in a downward spiral,but what about sales for the moment they are stationary but
we will not be able to improve them in fact well have to stop publication of,our encyclopedias of history and art history
with awful consequences for those working on these projects,are you saying that well have to lay people off no
no not for the moment but if things continue,like they are we will have to let some of our people go
my god there must be something we can do,to keep from cutting staff I am meeting with uh mr stevens this afternoon to
discuss the situation we are going to focus,on uh new objectives for the company in both marketing and sales
perhaps we will develop a new line of economic paperbacks which might help,sales but the other publishers are already
doing that successfully i think well need to develop new,products to encourage new market opportunities
well said billy uh ive already got an idea to suggest,it will not resolve all of our problems but it could
bring about some interesting developments and what might this new,idea be well anna are you in there hey
you I am looking for my friend anne is she with you,and surprise uh and hello come back to earth someones
looking for you alice uh what are you doing here,well i came to see where you work at could you give me a tour
sorry these are your colleagues with long faces uh you always like this,we need a little fun to lighten things up in here
why do not you invite them to the party this evening,no no no no no really i do not think well today is really not a good time to
be talking about parties why do not you come back some other time,and perhaps warn me in advance perhaps byebye alice
yes yes mr jones the collection is,divided into thematic volumes your volume will be the first uh dealing
with starters thats right yes,recipes should be written clearly and precisely

worry about you are a great team I am sure youll,think of something interesting okay gary did you get that email
problem fixed yes i did uh i set up a new account for you,you only have to create a new username and password
how do i do that I am hopeless with computers,i know you are in fact by now ive lost all hope with you
but you really do need to try to learn i mean,email and internet are indispensable in this day and age
i know i know gary you do not ever get tired of repeating that,i must admit I am a luddite how i miss the days when you wrote letters by
hand and visited the library to do research,everythings changed now i think ive done well
to learn to send and receive emails speaking of emails um i noticed what you,were writing to the authors and if youll permit me rachel
your emails are much too stuffy and formal,they do not fit in at all with internet jargon what are you saying
ill give you an example uh when you start off an email,you use wed like to inform you that it is quite oldfashioned you know it is
better to write did you know that or another example,when you need to make an excuse you begin we regret to inform you that
it is much better to use something like unfortunately we cannot,it is less formal but at the same time more professional
email needs to be kept simple and to the point use abbreviations,as often as possible and keep phrases short if you are writing to someone you
know well you can even add an emoticon it is always,a pleasure to get one an emoticon what the devil is
that you are so old school rachel emoticons are those little faces that,you can make using keyboard characters that
show how you are feeling at the time okay okay professor ill try to simplify,and use a more colloquial tone when writing
perhaps ill even put in a smiley it is not difficult youll see just let,the magic of the internet transport you but remember to use netiquette you are
talking like a computer manual what is netiquette it is good manners,on the internet it is the rules of the road of the network
rachel rachel rachel you really do need to get some practice do not you,ive got an idea why do not you let me sign you up for a forum
that way you can learn the rules of the road and the lingo as you surf,speaking of which do you like music music yes very much so
great then ill add podcasting sites to your favorites,so you can download podcasts and maybe even burn them to disk and stop

text,jack jack i was waiting for you have you
got a minute sure edward whats up you want to put some muscles in your film,jack you are are quite a joker i need some advice about a rather delicate
matter well it is about women well then you have come to the right person,when it comes to women you know all modesty I am sort of an expert go ahead
shoot but make it fast i have to get to the gym well do not worry it is like,this if a woman lets you mysteriously know that she has keen on you and if you
did not expect it but then you find that you do not mind the gesture in fact,because of this you find that you are becoming fond of her and if she acts as
if nothing has happened whoa whoa whoa edward what do you getting at i i do not,understand it is this a new idea for a film because if it is you should think
about rewriting this script it seems very convoluted to me jack stop joking,it is a serious matter i i just do not know how to behave i i cannot stand this
situation well okay lets take this from the,top so a woman goes for you however she does not do it
openly but then she pretends as if nothing is happened and as far as i can,tell you do not dislike the idea have i got it exactly what should i
do well the fact her behavior leads me to believe,that she has fond of games so use that
play the mysterious man and then surprise her with something special you,know like uh take her out to dinner or write her a poem or send her some red
roses women really go for that kind of thing,really i got an idea
great this spot should work well maybe here would be,better and ill put the card here next to
this lets give it a quick once over again,and i should have done this long ago now i cannot wait any
longer listen to my poetry written especially for,you you are perfume the color of all
flowers the breath and scent of the sea the worming strength of the sun,you the shining star that lights my
life who knows if shell like it what about these,roses will she like them and what if she makes fun of me
perhaps i should not have listened to jack but of course of course it makes no,sense to go on as if nothing has happened somebody has to take the first
step ill await you tomorrow night,here in the living room when everyone is asleep well be
able to be alone finally,alone okay that is done theres nothing more to do now but
wait and ill be home soon thank god alice will not be here at least for 2 hour,and jackie is at the gym yes i calculate everything perfectly now it is time for
me to leave as well i do not want him to see me,here here she is it is time to
go excellent great edward the moment of truth,approaches theyll never call me an amat again
right fine byebye always the door open bloody,cats what are these for
me they are beautiful i wonder who sent,them what
poetry who could have written it no no,man what are you thinking now do not be silly it cannot have been
jack my god then again he has the only person i,can imagine who would have written such lovely poetry
and my god what if it were jack,now that sharon is out of the picture and who would have ever thought that but
one day,jack hi an hi alice my are not we feeling chirpy today yes we are feeling
chirpy ive just received a mysterious and completely unexpected surprise so,what is it whats all the suspense for I am sorry
alice id like to keep it a secret for the time,being theres something i have to check up on first but do not worry ill tell
you soon enough now why do not you tell me hows,it going with edir hard by the look on your face i would
guess things are not going very well you said it a complete and utter,disaster i should never have written that
card why whats the matter thats the problem nothing has,happened edward acts as if hed never read that card and yet i know he read it
I am absolutely certain of why are you so sure well he told me in,no uncertain terms i fished around vaguely and he admitted that something
strange had happened and he also said that he was very,pleased and then nothing no words no actions at this point i think he was
referring to something else entirely or else i just have to accept,the fact that he is not interested in me do not get depressed
alice if you want my opinion i think you should have told him in,person face to face is always better than playing
games at any r you have still got time why do not you sit down and have an,earnest word with him no way to be embarrassed further
anyway theres something fishy about this whole story either edward is acting,like a complete fool or else he has not truly understood what i feel for
him i need some clarity from now on I am going to,scrutinize his every
move hi I am so happy you have accepted my,invitation what a strange voice you have i almost would not have recognized you is
that real you cannot imagine how ive longed for this moment really you,do not say to be truthful I am rather emotional
myself I am glad you feel that way so down boy i i really do not want to wake,the others the others never mind who cares if they find out actually id

what do you think of edward in what sense as a man or as a director do you,really have to ask as a man of course well ive just met him so i cannot
really say but um as a director my view is that he has a bit too,intrusive come on and get over it thats his job in my opinion i think he has just
great m whats this I am,hearing our little alice might be in love well
yes as i see it and this is the first time in my life ive fallen head over,heels in love so much in love but he does not even notice me you
know we share so many common interests and with we see things in the same way,we can talk for hours on end but it just ends there he looks on me as a good
friend nothing more nothing less you know I am really not used to that role,usually I am the one to keep others aa yes i remember um tom frank david how
many broken hearts have you left behind so tell me,have you asked edward how he feels about you no of course not look edward is not
interested in some relationship he has he has profound and,introspective spiritual he has a person who enjoys
observing and analyzing others yes if you ask me too much,so anyway i cannot agree with you I am afraid
even spiritual beings personal longings i think you should tell him and who,knows your edward might be much more human than you think maybe you are
right but i have to think of a special way to show him just how i,feel maybe i should see what my horoscope has to
say yes yes yes ive just had a brilliant,idea alice h are you feeling okay yeah hi an

lot ive been thinking about it so much i i have not slept well in,nights what have you been thinking jack about
us you are leaving for japan ive told you before and ill tell,you again sharon it is crazy you cannot leave now when when we
know how we feel jack you are repeating yourself,thats right and ill continue repeating myself
until you accept the truth,we are made for each other stop it you are embarrassing
me sharon listen i have not stopped loving,you and i know you feel the same about me thats it i said stop it and i meant
it look you made me cry and anyhow how do our feet feelings,change anything how do they change anything
they they change everything you must tell peter,immediately about everything tell him you will not
go I am so happy i knew you felt the same way about,me hey is anyone in there my god it is
peter he he cannot see me like this stay calm maybe it is time we tell him,everything jack
sharon what are you doing here ive been looking for you for half an,hour hey whats the matter you have been crying
are you going to explain to me whats going on or not peter listen calm down,I am not going to calm down i want answers and i want them now whats going
on here thats what id like to know jack and sharon have been here for who,knows how long and who knows what they have been
doing hey jack it is time you tell me whats up I am,going to get really mad if i do not get some
answers okay stop stop you are acting like little,children come on jack lets leave peter and sharon
alone they need to talk and and we need to go,shopping so shanon whats going
on peter i have to tell you something ive never told you,before ive known jack for a long time we went to the same university
together and well we were once engaged,what so thats why jack came to live here you have been seeing other have not
you shan no peter i swear it is true we just happened to meet him here it,happened by chance by chance thats a strange stroke of
luck just enough to bring back some old passionate,feelings theres how long has this been going on
sharon nothing has happened between jack and,i even if i do still have some feelings for
him after all peter you have been neglecting me for,months the only thing thats important to you is your
work you live eat and drink theater and nothing else so you are saying this is my,fault no one is at fault it is just that we want different
things from life at the moment ive had two interviews with the,director of the archaeology museum they want to open an art
exhibition and they have offered me a job do you understand,peter it means a job i would really love what are you getting at
sharon would you stay here and not go to japan if i asked you what kind of,question is that answer me peter it is
important ive accepted the job without asking me how could you and did you ask,me about japan did you peter
huh are you willing to stay here with me i uh i cannot,sharon this is my big chance you see peter I am
right nothing is more important to you than your,success so it is just you and me is not it an
well really it is just me all alone are you still,angry no i was just joking of
course itll be difficult to forget a man like you you are just pulling my leg,now are not you an i wanted to say
if it had been a a different time in my life or if,there werent sharon maybe we
would or rather maybe we,could too many ifs jack anyway I am happy for both you you
and sharon,really you know i adore love stories with happy endings hey do not jump to
conclusions sharon just left peter okay let things take their natural,course you know as alice would say if she were here i really miss her
craziness and her jokes the house just is not the same,without her thats true she always had something to
say i i miss so many,things like peter i even miss his singing exercises but they were awful
our poor ears i know but i was used to,them by the way how did things turn out in the end between you
two pretty well well we we had a long talk,and he understood it really was not my fault that it was
inevitable peter was just too involved with his career to notice sharons needs,and desires lets just say i took advantage
of their situation id say,so you have never met missed a chance like that in your life have
you it is late i have to,go I am late as usual by the way sharon and i are going
to see a film tonight would you like to,come thanks for the invitation jack um but uh i id prefer to stay
home anyway a possible new flatmate is coming to take a look at the apartment,and well his names nick well actually i ive got to get
things tidied up thats right cleanliness is next to,godliness huh do not work too hard
an perhaps nick is less tidy than alice,and i put together no i lost the battle with you two but
it is time to put an end to all this chaos ill ask him all the right,questions and but if i get the feeling he does not like cleaning i will not let him
in the door hi sharon,could i speak to you for a moment sure
peter I am listening you know i thought a lot about,what you told me
well i have to admit you are right i have not been paying very much,attention to you i will not be angry if you do not want
to stay with me,peter do not worry about me just look forward to your
musical it is your big break is not it if you werent so committed you,would not be the man for the job now would
you you are a star right yes i,know it just is not easy imagining japan without
you it will not be easy for me either but I am sure it is the right,decision for both of us i hope so if i were rich and famous already id
send along my private jet so you could visit me on weekends yeah,right the petrol alone would cost you your fortune who cares id be
rich so while i wait for you to bring your,career off and become rich i might come visit you maybe with
an but if you are famous youll forget all about,me youd let it go to your head and would not have time to take care of
me i couldnt keep up with all those beautiful young,actresses how could i forget you sharon by the
way would you mind me taking that beautiful photo of you,along to japan with me the one hanging in the living
room itll help me when i missing you especially in the,beginning of course peter take
it ill be happy to give it to you thank you well i have to get on with,packing one last thing if we were to meet in a few
years in two apartments close to each other you with your new,boyfriend would you pretend not to know me like you did with
jack why do you ask me that i do not know just,curious i guess it would be fun to meet you you somewhere else and have a little
secret between us two,okay sharon you remembered to buy the beer right of course i did and you
managed to bake the cake right not yet I am going to bake it this,afternoon i still need to get some chocolate actually jack offered to get
some for me he promised to bring some before lunch sorry but i cannot help you,with the cake i have to take some tourist to visit the tape gallery
do not worry about it ill have jack to help me he decided to stay home today to,give me a hand just do not forget to tell tom david
mary and all the others do not worry peter said hed take care of it I am sure,he has already got in touch with everybody by
phone great everything is going as planned do not forget to buy the,present do not worry how about getting an astrology book shed love that
absolutely she loves reading those kinds of,books i hope i can get it before i go to work by the way have you heard anything
from mr dubois well he told me he expected to come but couldnt confirm,but you know how it is being so busy and everything it is it is hard for him to

just look at me I am originally from bolognia which is,one of the best cities in the world when it comes to eating well i know bolognia
well it is a beautiful city even if i do prefer rome rome is much bigger and more,exciting so how does london compare london is not that bad apart from the
weather it certainly is much colder than in italy and the british are well how,should i say this they are less clever than the italians watch yourself jack

interesting and peter what do you do I am an actor and i u do a little singing I am,acting in a musical at the moment what a great career yes but it is certainly less
stressful than jacks line of work he works a lot harder than peter,but actually he has the hardest working person in the house and I am the person

speaking to you okay okay an you are right rules are,important but it is also important to laugh a little
ha haa hi everybody whats on,tv jack just a minute it is almost finished excuse
me,so what were you watching that was so
engrossing it was an extremely interesting documentary about picassos,life there were lots of details about some of his stranger habits did you know
that picasso preferred painting women with four eyes no i had no idea and that,he had lots of different types of dogs he used to give only dogs to his friends
strange is not it and that he liked eating italian cake at,christmas well i also go crazy for italian cake at christmas and my name
is not picasso by the way where is our resident,artist alice she left early this morning she said that she had something in
important to do she would not tell me what but she did say it was none of my,business you know how she is thats strange she usually leaves
late well as a matter of fact she was very serious this,morning she told me she had a headache but i did not believe
her look but it is getting,late I am starting to get
worried do not play mom in alice is a big girl now i know i know but it is just,that but she did not tell me she would be late in fact she asked me if i would be
late today just a moment a few days ago alice told me that she wanted to enter a,painting contest she said she thought it was her big
chance maybe thats where she is today,well you are probably right
but but it it is almost midnight i do not think contests last,that long why not we all know that artists are a little
crazy picasso was a perfect example thats true you know something,about being crazy jack do not you
good morning alice where were you last,night we were getting worried good
morning i prefer not to talk about it why what,happened well i took part in a young artist competition i thought it would be
the perfect occasion for for me to show my,talent so how did it go you made a great
impression did not you well no it went,badly they said that i was not cut out to be an
artist but the jury was made up of incompetence maybe no one appreciates my,talent come on now alice do not take it so
badly you know you are a genius right thats all that,matters yes just like van goof who by the way only became famous after he had
died maybe thats my destiny maybe you are exaggerating just a,little bit i mean van
go but you do not really think you are in the same league do you and why not no,one appreciates my talent either anyway i want your opinions wait
just a moment while i get,something my goodness here you
go this is the painting i took along yesterday what do you,think is not it beautiful
it is it is interesting um it is a very a very unique painting,yes unique is the right word uh alice you know i do not really understand art
do not you what does it,represent thats the same question they asked me
yesterday i cannot believe that it is so clear it is a painting of a man and a,woman walking hand in hand
i see mhm um well the truth is uh it is a bit,difficult to see i mean at first glance it looks like a
whole lot of mixed up colors come on jack you just do not,understand abstract art do you well now i understand that neither of
you has any appreciation of fine,art artists never tell an artist what you
really think I am the only child in my family,how many children do you want to have i was invited to his birthday party

surely more exciting than going to the cinema i agree with,alice lets go dancing
what about a third choice i guess an is right why do not we try to find a good,compromise come on guys how boring and oldfashioned you are and you are more
frivolous than i am alice come on guys do not argue now,please lets vote on it well alice and i want to go dancing peter and an do not
how about you sharon i do not know,well the disco is probably more entertaining than the cinema

paradise it is a new disco on kings road it is very nice did tom and you go there,together yes we went last saturday we spent a nice night together
together maybe i asked the wrong question you do not like tom do you he has,boring very boring besides he has in aries and he
talks too much last night for example he showed me all the pictures of his,holiday in the alps he talked for an hour about the mountains but i hate the
mountains why do you say that the mountains are beautiful and,spectacular i prefer the beach it is more relaxing and
entertaining i do not know i think the beach is more boring than the mountains,why do you say that well think about it lying on the beach every day it is much
more interesting to be walking in the countryside,yes but it is usually colder in the mountains i think the beach is also more
romantic girls stop talking nonsense how do i look you look very,pretty alice thanks sharon but you look better
than me no how can you say that you are much more tan than i am yes but you are,in better shape and
me how do i look you are very very pretty too,an I am sure I am not nearly as beautiful as
you come on guys stop making stupid comparisons lets just say that we are,all different hey girls okay are you ready i
need your advice which shirt is better according to you the red one it is much,better than the blue one for a disco night and you sharon what do you think

or i can say that I am a teacher I am a teacher,number two have you you can link them together
have you had breakfast remember this is a break,that when break and fast together we pronounce as
brec okay why i do not know okay break and this,is a break breakfast breakfast breakfast have you had breakfast have
you had breakfast number three lets take a,break lets take a break lets take a break
that means lets take a rest okay so we stopped,working lets take a break have a tea have a
coffee okay chat with each other for a little,bit and then we can come back to study or come back to work okay
break lets take a break lets take a break lets take a break,quite strange huh this is break and this is
breakfast number four would you you can link them together would you,would you like to eat cereal would you like to eat cereal
would you like to eat cereal that means do you want to eat cereal,her sister remembers sis her sister really
likes beef steak beef steak beef steak and,beans okay this is e a long e beans and this is egg okay beef steak
you can lick them together beef steak beef steak convinced her sister really,likes beef steak convinced one more time she has my teacher

now number one and from number one to number three the,shirts are too small for my
daughter to wear i am too young to,drive a car this cup of tea is too
hot for me to drink you can easily find out the grammar structure right,the shirts or eye of this cup is the subject r
m or is that is b to b,to and that is two small young or hot
adjective for my daughter here no for somebody,for me so you can act for somebody if you like and then
two to where to try to drive a car to drink so after that is,two infinitive infinitive that means the base form of
the verb or we do not add s e s e d,or in here just keep the base form of the verb so
two and then the infinitive now from number four to number six,we would find out another grammar structure
the book seemed too boring for us to read,i think your son looks too short to play basketball
the noodles taste too spicy for her to eat,the book i think i think it is not important
the subject here is your sun and then the noodles so the subject,first and then seemed looks
taste as you can see they are not to be they are verbs,but they are not normal verbs normal verbs used to describe
action you know study run joke listen but,this one seems looked taste they are linking verbs
linking verbs do not describe actions they describe state or feeling,usually relates to five senses you know eyes ears
nose eyes or your hands so we have the linking verbs,look hear smell taste and feel number seven
to number nine the teacher spoke too,fast for the students to understand she studied too lazily
to pass the sorry the final exam my brother,runs too slowly to catch me up the teacher
she my brother the subject after that spoke you know past simple of,speak study run
so i like to be other linking verbs they are,normal verbs so verb subject verb they you know spoke
study and runs they describe actions so they are normal verbs and then,two two two two and then now after two fast
lazily slowly are they adjectives no they are adverbs,so remember after verb adverbs now and then for the students here
no for somebody no okay so you can act for somebody if you like and,then to understand to pass
or to catch so after that is two infinitive 2,text

with you if you do not lie however if someone does y to you then it is only,polite to return the greeting is that the only time of y is performed no thai
people also show respect to images of the king and lord buddha in the same way,although when the y is performed on these occasions the hands are held
higher and the head is bowed lower the gesture can mean not only hello but also,thank you goodbye and I am sorry wow i did not know that
thanks for your advice i heard that thai food is very delicious is it very spicy,thai food is wonderful but a lot of our dishes are made using chilies so be
careful especially if you are not used to hot food is it possible to eat food that,is not very spicy yes there are a number of dishes that are not too spicy look out
for dishes that are made using coconut milk those tend to be less spicy is,there any thai food i should watch out for my advice is to try everything but
do be careful if you buy food from a street vendor they are not governed by,the health authority so the food might not be as clean or
prepared as the food you would get in a restaurant thank you you have been very,helpful no problem what do traditional thai
homes look like well traditional homes were made from teak they had ornate,roofs and were usually built on stilts nowadays most people live in modern
houses or apartments what should i do if I am invited to a thai house thai people,are very hospitable so it is not unusual to be invited into someones home are
there any dos and donts well you must remember to take your shoes off at the,door thats the most important thing what should i expect you probably be
offered something to eat and drink a glass of water a cup of coffee some,fruit whatever is at hand really but what if I am not hungry or thirsty you
should try something to refuse even a taste might be considered impolite thank,you thats good advice  no you are welcome unit six shopping
can you tell me the best place to go shopping there are many places you can,buy inexpensive gifts and souvenirs from department stores and shopping malls to
markets and street vendors what kind of things should i buy traditional thai,handicrafts include cotton and silk weaving i definitely want to buy some
silk do you have any other suggestions paper parasols and wood carvings are,other popular gift items if giving me some very useful yes thank you what is
the best market to go to the best one here in bangkok is the justits a,freaking market is that the biggest yes it is huge you can buy just about
anything there and what about the floating market bangkok used to have,many floating markets until they started to fill in the canals there are still
several around but some of them are now just tourist shows probably the most,authentic one is the demands of the work floating market is that worth going to
certainly there are pictures of floating markets everywhere around thailand and,the trip to bangkok would not be complete without a look at one do you have any
advice for my visit to the market today hmm be prepared to barter you can get,some real bargains but watch out the vendors will start by asking a high
price for their goods you can usually knock them down a lot though hmm,that could be fun is there anything else i should know it is very hot so make sure
you drink plenty of water thank you i will there is one more thing it is very,crowded and there may be pickpocket around so be careful with your wallet
okay thanks for the advice unit seven religion if you are going to,visit any temple then there are a few things you should know yeah go ahead
well temples are sacred places so you should dress politely okay what kind of,things should i avoid wearing you should not wear shorts or sleeveless tops
and you may be refused admission if you are not wearing shoes with closed,heels and toes make sure you take your shoes off though before you go inside
ill remember that is there anything else just be careful not to tread on the,doorframe when you step inside and if you sit down then do not point your feet
towards the buddha can i kneel or sit crosslegged yes either spine the most,celebrated architectural form of thailand is the what the thai buddhist
temple complex so the wat is comprised of more than one,building yes a what is made up of several buildings that serve all the
religious needs of the monastic community there seem to be a lot of,temples in thailand there are thailand has nearly 18000 buddhist temples
throughout the country wow thats a lot well the temples provide religious,sanctuaries for thailands buddhists who account for about 95 percent of the
population the temples are covered with the most beautiful paintings we are very,proud of them the mural paintings are one of thailands great artistic
achievements do they all depict similar stories well all the scenes are inspired,by buddhist doctrines and are usually intended to teach the worshippers about
religion and morality ive seen miniature temples next to peoples,houses what are they for ah theres spirit
houses every tight house or building has one so people believe that spirits live,in them yes thai people believe sacred spirits live
in their houses the spirits are called pappu they make special spirit houses,for pappu to live in i spend some type evil putting flowers and things inside
the family paid their respects to pop him at the spirit house so the spirits,will protect the family and bring good fortune thank you thats very
interesting we have nothing like that back home unit 8 bangkoks detractions,when was the grand palace built king
